### Guiding Principles for v2
- Maintain modularity, testability, and robust error handling throughout.
- Each v2 feature phase should be independently testable and deliver incremental value.
- Preserve Codespaces compatibility and document all new dependencies or environment changes.
- Continue to use PLAN.md and TODO.md for tracking major decisions and actionable tasks.

---

## v2 Feature Goals
- Z-Score forecasting using consensus estimates and/or time series models
- News and sentiment integration for risk/diagnostic context
- Extensible architecture for future portfolio/multi-ticker analysis
- Maintain and improve reporting, error handling, and documentation standards

## Background
This plan is based on the new concept outlined in `OneStockAnalysis.md` and incorporates Altman's Z-Score model documentation. The goal is to create a robust, modular, and testable Altman Z-Score analysis tool for single stocks and portfolios, with a focus on reliability, data integrity, and ease of maintenance.

## High-Level Goals
- **Simplicity:** Start with a single-stock analysis pipeline, then generalize to portfolios.
- **Modularity:** Clean separation of data fetching, validation, computation, and reporting.
- **Testability:** Each module is independently testable with clear interfaces.
- **Robustness:** Strong error handling, logging, and data validation at every step.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new data sources, models, or output formats.
- **Best Practices:** Use industry/maturity calibration, and follow professional analyst standards.

## Architecture Overview
1. **Input Layer**
   - Accepts a ticker (or list of tickers) and analysis date.
   - Validates input format and existence.
   - Optionally accepts industry and company maturity overrides.
2. **Data Fetching Layer**
   - Fetches financials from SEC EDGAR (XBRL) using `sec-api` or `sec-edgar-downloader`.
   - Parses XBRL using `xbrlparse` (latest maintained).
   - Fetches market data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
   - Optionally fetches industry/maturity benchmarks from public datasets (e.g., WRDS, Compustat, or open data).
3. **Validation Layer**
   - Validates raw data using Pydantic schemas.
   - Reports missing/invalid fields and halts or warns as appropriate.
   - Ensures all Z-Score components are present and reasonable.
4. **Computation Layer**
   - Computes Altman Z-Score using validated data.
   - Calibrates Z-Score by industry and company maturity (using latest academic coefficients and benchmarks).
   - Returns result object with all intermediate values, calibration details, and errors.
5. **Reporting Layer**
   - Outputs results to CSV, JSON, or stdout.
   - Plots Z-Score trend (matplotlib/plotly).
   - Logs all steps and errors for traceability.
   - (v1) Overlays price trend; (v2) overlays sentiment/news.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Bootstrap New Codebase**
   - Scaffold `src/altman_zscore/one_stock_analysis.py` for the single-stock pipeline.
   - Use only minimal, modern dependencies (`pandas`, `requests`, `pydantic`, `yfinance`, `sec-api`, `xbrlparse`, `matplotlib`/`plotly`).
2. **Implement Input & Config Handling**
   - Parse CLI args or function params for ticker, date, industry, and maturity.
   - Validate inputs.
3. **Implement Data Fetching**
   - Write `fetch_sec_financials(ticker, date)` using `sec-api` or `sec-edgar-downloader`.
   - Parse XBRL with `xbrlparse`.
   - Write `fetch_yahoo_market_data(ticker, date)` using `yfinance`.
   - Fetch industry/maturity benchmarks if available.
4. **Implement Validation Schemas**
   - Create Pydantic models in `schemas/validation.py` for all expected data.
   - Validate fetched data and report issues.
5. **Implement Z-Score Computation**
   - Write a pure function `compute_zscore(validated_data, industry, maturity)` .
   - Use latest Altman Z-Score models (original, emerging markets, service, private, etc.).
   - Calibrate coefficients and thresholds by industry and maturity.
   - Return result object with all components and calibration details.
6. **Implement Reporting**
   - Output result to CSV/JSON and log all steps.
   - Plot Z-Score trend (matplotlib/plotly).
   - (v1) Overlay price trend; (v2) overlay sentiment/news.
   - **Generate full analysis report as output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_full_report.txt, including context, field mapping, Z-Score component table with risk area, and all formulas.**
   - **Ensure all output is robust, well-formatted, and includes all key context and diagnostics.**
7. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for each module.
   - Add integration test for the full pipeline.
8. **Iterate and Generalize**
   - Once single-stock works, generalize to portfolio analysis.
   - Refactor as needed for extensibility and maintainability.

## Best Practices & Analyst Guidance
- **Data Quality:** Always validate and cross-check financials; flag outliers and missing data.
- **Calibration:** Use industry and maturity-specific Z-Score coefficients and thresholds (see latest Altman research and WRDS/Compustat/academic sources).
- **Documentation:** Clearly document all assumptions, calibration sources, and limitations.
- **Transparency:** Log all data sources, errors, and calibration steps for auditability.
- **Testing:** Use real-world tickers and edge cases in tests.

- Test thoroughly at each step before enabling new features.
- Only enable new features after the MVP is stable and well-tested.
- Light up features one at a time, with tests and documentation, to avoid regressions.
- Avoid over-ambitious changes; prioritize reliability and maintainability.

## Project Guidance
- Use this PLAN.md for high-level features, vision, and progress tracking.
- Use TODO.md for actionable tasks, environment setup, and phase-specific work.
- All development and testing is performed in a consistent development environmentâ€”ensure compatibility at every step.
- Preserve modularity, testability, and robust error handling throughout.
- Each feature phase should be independently testable and deliver incremental value.

- **Alternative:** [Compustat](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/solutions/compustat-research-insight) (not free, but some open datasets exist)
- **Free/Public:** Use published Altman Z-Score coefficients by industry from academic papers or open data repositories (document sources in APIS.md)

### General Principles
- Prefer official, free, and well-documented APIs/libraries.
- Use backup sources for redundancy and validation.
- Document all API usage, rate limits, and licensing in APIS.md.
- Avoid paid APIs unless absolutely necessary for critical features.

## Updated Entry Point
- The main entry point for the Altman Z-Score analysis pipeline has been updated to `main.py` in the project root (formerly `altman_zscore.py`).
- All references to `one_stock_analysis.py` in the documentation and examples have been updated accordingly.
- All outputs are now organized by ticker in `output/<TICKER>/`.
- Ensure that the new entry point is tested and validated for all supported tickers.

## Qualitative Validation & News Integration (v2+)

- Each Z-Score report now includes an LLM-generated qualitative validation section.
- This section provides:
  - A concise summary contextualizing the Z-Score result (e.g., "Safe Zone", "Distress Zone")
  - 2-3 recent news headlines with links (Markdown format)
  - Explicit references to credit ratings, analyst reports, and news sources
- The prompt template for the LLM explicitly requests news headlines with links and reference lists.
- This approach ensures every report is actionable, reference-backed, and easy to audit.
- The platform is now ready for further sentiment analysis, news/sentiment trend charts, and portfolio-level analytics in future versions.

## Plotting and Visualization Improvements (May 29, 2025)
- **Enhanced Z-Score and Stock Price Visualizations:** 
  - âœ… Improved label positioning with Z-Score values above markers and price values above their points
  - âœ… Implemented I-shaped whiskers with horizontal caps for price range indicators
  - âœ… Optimized y-axis scaling to prevent overlapping between Z-Score and price data
  - âœ… Enhanced color scheme with darker gray for price axis and better readability
  - âœ… Fixed indentation issues in plotting code with consistent 4-space indentation
  - âœ… Added responsive margins to both axes to accommodate different data ranges
  - âœ… Added proper parameter names in annotate functions for better code quality
- **Example Reports:**
  - âœ… Added example output reports to the repository for demonstration purposes
  - âœ… Updated README.md with "Output Examples" section explaining the included reports
  - âœ… All examples now show properly formatted Z-Score trend analysis with price overlay

## Prompt Ingestion for LLM Analysis (May 2025)

- All LLM prompt files are now stored in `src/prompts/` for clarity and maintainability.
- The pipeline reads these files at runtime and combines them with the current report context before sending to the LLM.
- Any changes to these prompt files are immediately reflected in all future reportsâ€”no code changes required.
- This enables full transparency, reproducibility, and user control over the LLM's analysis style, instructions, and references.
- See `README.md` for user instructions and workflow.

---

## Change Log: DOCX/Word Export Removal (May 29, 2025)
- The DOCX/Word export feature has been removed from the codebase due to persistent formatting and chart embedding issues.
- All documentation and code references to DOCX/Word export have been removed.
- Reports are now generated in Markdown format only.

### Rationale
- The DOCX export feature did not meet professional standards for formatting and chart/image embedding.
- Markdown output remains robust, portable, and easy to convert to other formats if needed.

### Next Steps
- If high-quality Word export is required in the future, consider using a dedicated Markdown-to-Word tool or service outside this codebase.

# PLAN: Field Mapping and Internationalization Improvements (May 2025)

## Objective
Enhance the Altman Z-Score pipeline's field mapping, internationalization, and robustness for global and emerging market tickers, with a focus on banks/financials and user transparency.

---

## 1. Expand FIELD_SYNONYMS
- Add more synonyms for each canonical field, especially for banks and international companies (Portuguese, Spanish, French, etc.).
- Include terms like "Receita de Juros" (Interest Income), "Lucro LÃ­quido" (Net Income), etc.

## 2. Bank/Financial Institution Awareness
- Detect if a company is a bank/financial institution (from sector/industry or ticker list).
- Adjust mapping priorities for banks (e.g., map 'sales' to 'Interest Income' if no revenue field is present).

## 3. Partial/Fallback Mapping Reporting
- When a field cannot be mapped, include a 'Reason' in the returned mapping (e.g., 'No revenue field found; company may be a bank').
- Surface this in the report for transparency.

## 4. Sample Value Matching
- Use sample_values (if provided) to improve mapping confidence (e.g., match by value type/range).

## 5. Case-Insensitive and Accent-Insensitive Matching
- Normalize field names (lowercase, remove accents/diacritics) before matching.

## 6. Logging and Diagnostics
- Add granular logging for mapping decisions, especially for fallbacks and unmapped fields.

## 7. User-Editable Mapping Overrides
- Allow user to provide a mapping override file (e.g., mapping_overrides.json) for persistent issues.

## 8. Unit Tests for Mapping Logic
- Add/expand unit tests for edge cases, especially for international tickers and banks.

## 9. Graceful Handling of LLM Failures
- If LLM response is malformed/missing, fall back to code-level synonym matching and log a warning.

## 10. Documentation
- Document mapping logic, fallback rules, and internationalization in README or a dedicated doc.

---

## Next Steps
- Prioritize FIELD_SYNONYMS expansion and bank awareness logic.
- Implement fallback reporting and logging.
- Add user-editable mapping override support.
- Update tests and documentation.
