# Vision: Exceeding the Competition

Our goal is to deliver an Altman Z-Score platform that not only matches but surpasses the capabilities of all current and future competitors—open-source or commercial. Every feature, architectural decision, and user experience is designed to set a new industry standard for transparency, extensibility, and actionable financial insight.

## Features to Match or Exceed (from other projects and commercial products)

- **Sector/Industry Benchmarking:** Peer comparison and sector-based risk context.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Web-based or Excel add-in dashboards for visualization and exploration.
- **Automated Alerting:** Email, Slack, or webhook alerts for risk thresholds or significant changes.
- **API Access:** Programmatic interface for integration with other systems and workflows.
- **International Support:** Analysis for companies using US GAAP, IFRS, and other standards.
- **Advanced Model Selection:** Region, sector, and company maturity-aware model selection.
- **Downloadable Reports:** Audit-ready outputs in PDF, Excel, and Markdown formats.
- **BI Tool Integration:** Export and connect to Power BI, Tableau, and other analytics platforms.
- **Real-Time/Scheduled Updates:** Automated data refresh and scheduled analysis runs.
- **User Management & SaaS Features:** RBAC, multi-user support, and hosted SaaS options (for commercial parity).
- **Customizable Models:** User-editable risk models, thresholds, and calibration data.
- **Transparent Versioning:** All model logic, calibration, and outputs are versioned and documented.

By targeting these features, we ensure the platform remains best-in-class and competitive with both open-source and commercial offerings.
