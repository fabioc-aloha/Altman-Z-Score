## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) has shown a negative trend in its liquidity ratio (X1), indicating that current liabilities exceed current assets. This situation suggests potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations, which is a critical concern for stakeholders.

### Profitability
The profitability ratio (X3) indicates that AZN is generating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to its total assets. The recent values hover around 0.02 to 0.035, which, while not alarming, suggests that profitability is not robust enough to significantly enhance the Z-Score.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2) reflects the company's ability to reinvest profits back into the business. The values around 0.03 indicate a modest level of retained earnings relative to total assets, which could limit growth opportunities.

### Leverage
The equity to liabilities ratio (X4) is strong at approximately 3.5, indicating that AZN has a solid capital structure with a low level of debt relative to equity. This is a positive sign, suggesting that the company is less vulnerable to financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has fluctuated between 2.09 and 2.45 over the last four quarters, consistently landing in the Grey Zone (1.81 < Z < 2.99). This indicates that while AZN is not in immediate danger of bankruptcy, it is at risk and requires strategic management to improve its financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment strategies should focus on cost-cutting measures, improving cash flow, and stabilizing operations. For AZN, this could involve:
- Reducing operational costs through efficiency improvements.
- Streamlining product lines to focus on high-margin products.
- Enhancing cash flow management to ensure liquidity.

### Long-Term Repositioning
Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of long-term strategies for sustainable growth. AZN should consider:
- Investing in R&D to innovate and expand its product portfolio.
- Exploring strategic partnerships or acquisitions to enhance market presence.
- Implementing a robust marketing strategy to improve brand positioning and customer engagement.
