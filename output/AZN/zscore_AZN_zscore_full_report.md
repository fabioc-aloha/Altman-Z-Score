## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) has shown a negative trend in its liquidity ratio (X1), indicating that current assets are insufficient to cover current liabilities. This is a concerning sign as it suggests potential cash flow issues that could affect the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The retained earnings ratio (X2) remains low but positive, indicating that the company has been able to retain some earnings over time. However, the low value suggests that profitability may not be robust enough to support significant growth or reinvestment.

### Capital Efficiency
The EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) is modest, reflecting a reasonable level of operational efficiency. However, it is essential to monitor this metric closely as it can indicate how well the company is utilizing its assets to generate earnings.

### Leverage
The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is strong, suggesting that AstraZeneca is not overly leveraged and has a solid capital structure. This is a positive indicator of financial stability, as it implies that the company can withstand financial distress better than its peers.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the grey zone (between 1.5 and 3.1) over the past quarters, indicating that while AstraZeneca is not in immediate danger of bankruptcy, it is also not in a strong financial position. The trend suggests a need for strategic intervention to improve financial health and move towards the safe zone.

## 2. Proposed Phased Response

### Immediate Retrenchment
In line with Hofer's turnaround strategies (1980), immediate actions should focus on cost-cutting measures to stabilize cash flow. This includes:

- **Reducing operational costs:** Streamlining operations and eliminating non-essential expenditures.
- **Improving cash management:** Tightening credit terms and accelerating receivables collection.

### Long-term Repositioning
For sustainable recovery, AstraZeneca should consider long-term strategies as outlined by Bibeault (1999) and Hoskisson et al. (2004):

- **Investing in R&D:** Focusing on innovation to drive future growth, particularly in high-demand therapeutic areas.
- **Market expansion:** Exploring new markets and partnerships to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependency on existing products.
