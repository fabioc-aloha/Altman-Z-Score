# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
GoPro, Inc. (GPRO) has been experiencing significant financial distress, as indicated by its consistently negative Altman Z-Scores over the past five quarters. The Z-Score trend shows a downward trajectory, with the most recent score of -2.181 indicating a high likelihood of bankruptcy. This analysis will evaluate the company's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: The current assets of $278.8 million against current liabilities of $316.9 million yield a current ratio of 0.88, indicating that GoPro does not have sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. This is a critical liquidity concern.

### Profitability
- **EBIT**: GoPro reported negative EBIT figures across all quarters, with the latest quarter showing an EBIT of -$44.3 million. This indicates that the company is not generating enough operational income to cover its expenses, which is detrimental to its profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
- **Retained Earnings**: The retained earnings are significantly negative at -$728.3 million, reflecting accumulated losses over time. This suggests that the company has not been able to reinvest profits into growth or sustainability.

### Leverage
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: The market value of equity is $110 million against total liabilities of $352.5 million, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 3.20. This high leverage indicates that GoPro is heavily reliant on debt financing, increasing its financial risk.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend shows a consistent decline from -0.578 in Q1 2024 to -2.181 in Q1 2025. This downward trend signifies deteriorating financial health and an increasing risk of bankruptcy. The company is firmly in the "Distress Zone," necessitating immediate strategic interventions.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, a phased response is necessary, distinguishing between immediate retrenchment and long-term repositioning.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment** (Short-term Focus)
   - **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and operational efficiencies (Bibeault, 1999).
   - **Asset Liquidation**: Identify non-core assets for sale to improve liquidity (Hoskisson et al., 2004).

2. **Long-term Repositioning** (Strategic Focus)
   - **Market Reassessment**: Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new growth opportunities and potential product innovations (Hofer, 1980).
   - **Stakeholder Engagement**: Foster relationships with key stakeholders to rebuild trust and support for the turnaround strategy (Freeman, 1984).
