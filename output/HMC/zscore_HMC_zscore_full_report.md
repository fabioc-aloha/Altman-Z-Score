# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Honda Motor Company (HMC) has a current ratio (X1) that fluctuates around 0.1 to 0.12, indicating that its current assets exceed current liabilities, but only marginally. This suggests that while HMC can cover its short-term obligations, the liquidity position is tight, which may pose risks if unexpected expenses arise.

### Profitability
The retained earnings ratio (X2) shows a consistent value around 0.35 to 0.37, indicating that HMC has a solid base of retained earnings relative to total assets. However, the EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) is low, hovering around 0.014 to 0.018, which suggests that the company is not generating significant operating income relative to its asset base.

### Capital Efficiency
The market value of equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is extremely low, ranging from 0.002 to 0.003, indicating that the market perceives HMC as having a high level of debt relative to its equity. This could limit the company's ability to raise capital in the future.

### Leverage
The sales to total assets ratio (X5) is around 0.173 to 0.184, which indicates that HMC is generating a moderate level of sales relative to its asset base. However, the overall leverage situation appears precarious given the low market value of equity.

### Z-Score Trend
The Z-Score for HMC has consistently remained below 1.0, indicating that the company is in the "Distress Zone." This trend suggests a high risk of bankruptcy, as the Z-Score has not shown significant improvement over the analyzed quarters. The company needs to take immediate action to improve its financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980) and Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment strategies are essential for companies in distress. HMC should focus on cost-cutting measures, including:

- Reducing operational costs through workforce optimization and renegotiating supplier contracts.
- Divesting non-core assets to improve liquidity.
- Streamlining product lines to focus on high-margin vehicles.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Hoskisson et al. (2004) suggest that companies should invest in innovation and market differentiation. HMC should:

- Invest in electric vehicle (EV) technology to align with market trends.
- Enhance marketing strategies to improve brand perception and customer loyalty.
- Develop strategic partnerships to leverage shared resources and capabilities.
