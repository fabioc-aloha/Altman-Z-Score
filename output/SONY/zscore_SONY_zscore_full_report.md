## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Sony Group Corporation, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, is concerning. The negative value of -0.098 in Q4 2024 suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets, indicating potential cash flow issues. This situation raises alarms about the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) shows a very low EBIT to total assets ratio of 0.014, which indicates that the company is generating minimal earnings relative to its asset base. This low profitability can be a significant concern for stakeholders, as it suggests inefficiencies in asset utilization.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings to total assets ratio (X2) of 0.18 indicates that a portion of the company's assets is financed through retained earnings. However, the declining trend in retained earnings could signal challenges in reinvesting profits for growth.

### Leverage
The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is alarmingly low at 0.005, suggesting that the company is heavily leveraged. This high level of debt relative to equity increases financial risk and could lead to solvency issues if not addressed promptly.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend for Sony shows a consistent decline, with a score of 0.306 in Q4 2024, placing the company firmly in the distress zone (Z â‰¤ 1.81). This trend indicates a deteriorating financial condition, necessitating immediate action to avert bankruptcy.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment is essential for companies in distress. Sony should focus on cost-cutting measures, including:
- Reducing operational costs through workforce optimization and renegotiating supplier contracts.
- Halting non-essential capital expenditures to conserve cash.

### Long-term Repositioning
Long-term repositioning strategies, as discussed by Hofer (1980), should include:
- Diversifying product offerings to reduce dependency on underperforming segments.
- Investing in innovation and technology to enhance competitive advantage and market share.

### Phased Response
1. **Phase 1: Stabilization** (0-6 months)
   - Implement immediate cost-cutting measures.
   - Conduct a thorough review of current operations to identify inefficiencies.

2. **Phase 2: Strategic Renewal** (6-12 months)
   - Develop a new product strategy focusing on high-growth areas.
   - Engage with stakeholders to rebuild trust and support.

3. **Phase 3: Growth and Expansion** (1-3 years)
   - Invest in R&D to foster innovation.
   - Explore strategic partnerships or acquisitions to enhance market position.
