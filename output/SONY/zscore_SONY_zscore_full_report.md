# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Sony Group Corporation is concerning, as indicated by the negative values for X1 (Working Capital / Total Assets). The negative working capital suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets, which raises red flags regarding the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT / Total Assets), show minimal earnings relative to total assets. The low EBIT indicates that the company is not generating sufficient operating income, which can hinder its ability to reinvest in growth or pay down debt.

### Capital Efficiency
X2 (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) reflects a moderate level of retained earnings, indicating that the company has retained some profits over time. However, the low value suggests that the company may not be effectively utilizing its assets to generate returns.

### Leverage
X4 (Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities) is alarmingly low, indicating that the market does not value the equity sufficiently to cover total liabilities. This could signal a lack of investor confidence and potential solvency issues.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Sony has consistently remained in the distress zone, with values below 1.81 across the last four quarters. The trend shows a slight decline from 0.306 in Q4 2024 to 0.232 in Q2 2024, indicating deteriorating financial health. This trend suggests that immediate action is required to avoid bankruptcy.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and operational efficiency improvements. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the importance of reducing costs to stabilize cash flow.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Identify non-core assets for sale to improve liquidity. This is consistent with Hofer's (1980) emphasis on asset management during turnaround situations.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify growth opportunities and potential new markets. This aligns with Hoskisson et al. (2004), who advocate for strategic restructuring in response to market changes.
   - **Innovation and R&D Investment:** Increase investment in research and development to foster innovation, which is crucial for long-term sustainability in the technology sector (Beard, 2024).
