## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Sony Group Corporation is concerning, as indicated by the negative values for X1 (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets. This suggests that the company is struggling to meet its short-term obligations, which is critical for operational stability.

### Profitability
The retained earnings (X2) are relatively low, indicating that the company has not been able to accumulate significant profits over time. This could be a result of high operational costs or declining revenues, which is further supported by the low EBIT (X3) relative to total assets.

### Capital Efficiency
The capital efficiency, represented by X5 (Sales / Total Assets), is also low, suggesting that Sony is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate sales. This inefficiency can lead to reduced profitability and cash flow issues.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4), which measures equity against total liabilities, is alarmingly low. This indicates that the company is highly leveraged, increasing its financial risk and vulnerability to market fluctuations.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend shows a consistent decline, with the company remaining in the distress zone (Z-Score < 1.81) for the last four quarters. This trend is alarming and indicates a deteriorating financial condition, requiring immediate management intervention.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment strategies should focus on cutting costs and stabilizing cash flows. This includes:
- Reducing operational expenses by streamlining processes.
- Divesting non-core assets to improve liquidity.
- Implementing a hiring freeze and reducing workforce where necessary.

### Long-term Repositioning
Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of long-term strategies for sustainable recovery. Sony should consider:
- Innovating product lines to meet changing consumer preferences.
- Investing in research and development to enhance competitive advantage.
- Exploring new markets and partnerships to diversify revenue streams.
