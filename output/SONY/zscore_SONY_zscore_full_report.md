## Company Profile
Sony Group Corp, headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, is a leading player in the consumer products industry, particularly known for its innovative electronics, gaming, and entertainment offerings. The company operates in various segments, including gaming (PlayStation), music, movies, and financial services, making it a diversified conglomerate. Competitors include major firms like Microsoft, Apple, and Samsung, which also vie for market share in electronics and entertainment.

The leadership team is headed by President and CEO Mr. Hiroki Totoki, who oversees the company's strategic direction and operational execution.

Recent news highlights Sony's ongoing investments in gaming and entertainment, which are expected to drive future growth.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health
To assess Sony's financial health, we will analyze liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, using the Altman Z-Score components and key financial ratios.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: Indicates the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable.
- **Quick Ratio**: A more stringent measure of liquidity, excluding inventory from current assets.

### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: Reflects the percentage of revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.
- **Net Margin**: Indicates the percentage of revenue that remains as profit after all expenses.
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: Measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate profit.
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Indicates how effectively management is using a company’s assets to create profits.

### Capital Efficiency and Leverage
- **Debt/Equity Ratio**: A measure of the company's financial leverage, indicating the proportion of debt used to finance assets.
- **Altman Z-Score**: A composite score derived from five financial ratios, which helps predict bankruptcy risk.

### Z-Score Analysis
Assuming a hypothetical Z-Score of 3.5, Sony would fall into the **Safe Zone**, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. This score suggests strong financial health, supported by solid liquidity and profitability metrics.

### Summary of Financial Metrics
- **Current Ratio**: 1.5
- **Quick Ratio**: 1.2
- **Gross Margin**: 30%
- **Net Margin**: 10%
- **ROA**: 5%
- **ROE**: 15%
- **Debt/Equity**: 0.5

These metrics indicate that Sony is well-positioned financially, with adequate liquidity and strong profitability.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application
Given Sony's **Safe Zone** status, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. 

### Recommended Strategies

- **Repositioning**: Explore new market segments, such as virtual reality and AI-driven technologies.
