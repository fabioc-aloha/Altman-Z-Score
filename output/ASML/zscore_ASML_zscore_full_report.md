## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
ASML maintains a healthy liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. The trend shows a slight decrease, but it remains above the industry average, suggesting that ASML can meet its short-term obligations without significant risk.

### Profitability
The X2 component, representing retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, indicates that ASML has a solid profitability foundation. The consistent values in this component suggest that the company has been effectively reinvesting its earnings, which is crucial for long-term growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component, which measures EBIT relative to total assets, shows a slight decline over the quarters. This indicates that while ASML is generating profits, there may be room for improvement in capital efficiency. The company should focus on optimizing its asset utilization to enhance profitability.

### Leverage
The X4 component indicates a strong equity position relative to liabilities, suggesting that ASML is not overly reliant on debt financing. This is a positive indicator of financial stability, as it reduces the risk associated with financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend indicates that ASML is firmly in the "Safe Zone," with scores consistently above 5. This suggests that the company is financially healthy and has a low risk of bankruptcy. However, the slight downward trend in some components warrants attention to ensure that the company maintains its strong position.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment**
   - **Cost Control:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to enhance profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on financial discipline during turnaround situations.
   - **Asset Optimization:** Review and optimize asset utilization to improve the X3 component of the Z-Score, focusing on operational efficiencies.

2. **Long-term Repositioning**
   - **Strategic Investment:** Invest in R&D to foster innovation and maintain competitive advantage, as suggested by Beard (2024). This will help ASML adapt to changing market dynamics.
   - **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets and customer segments to diversify revenue streams, aligning with Hofer's (1980) strategies for corporate renewal.
