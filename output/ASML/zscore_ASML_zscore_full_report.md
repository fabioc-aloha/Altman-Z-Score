## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
ASML demonstrates strong liquidity, as evidenced by its X1 ratio (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, which remains consistently above 0.20. This indicates that the company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its liabilities, reflecting a solid liquidity position.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT / Total Assets), show a gradual increase from 0.073 in Q4 2024 to 0.090 in Q3 2025. This upward trend suggests that ASML is effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings, which is a positive indicator of operational efficiency.

### Capital Efficiency
X2 (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) remains stable, indicating that ASML is retaining a significant portion of its earnings for reinvestment. This is crucial for long-term growth and sustainability.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio, X4 (Equity / Total Liabilities), is exceptionally high at around 9.0, indicating that ASML is primarily financed through equity rather than debt. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances the company's stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a high score of 7.000 in Q3 2025. This indicates a low probability of bankruptcy and reflects ASML's strong financial health. The trend suggests that the company is well-positioned to navigate potential economic challenges.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Innovation Investment:** Allocate resources towards R&D to maintain competitive advantage, reflecting Hoskisson et al.'s (2004) focus on strategic renewal.
