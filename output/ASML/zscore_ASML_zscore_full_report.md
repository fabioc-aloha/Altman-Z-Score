## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of ASML Holding N.V. is robust, as indicated by the current ratio derived from the Z-Score component X1, which stands at 0.22. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, although it is essential to monitor this closely to ensure it remains above industry benchmarks.

### Profitability
The profitability of ASML is reflected in its retained earnings (X2), which is 29.7% of total assets. This indicates a strong historical profitability and reinvestment strategy, positioning the company well for future growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) is 7.3%, suggesting that ASML is effectively generating earnings from its assets. This level of capital efficiency is favorable and indicates that the company is utilizing its resources effectively.

### Leverage
The market value of equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is exceptionally high at 9.003, indicating that ASML is not heavily leveraged and has a strong equity cushion. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances the company's stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The overall Z-Score of 6.512 places ASML in the "Safe Zone," indicating a low probability of bankruptcy in the near term. This score reflects a strong financial position, but continuous monitoring is necessary to maintain this status, especially in the face of market fluctuations.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
In the short term, ASML should focus on cost control measures to enhance liquidity further. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the importance of immediate financial health improvements. Key actions include:

- **Cost Reduction Initiatives:** Identify non-essential expenditures and implement a freeze on discretionary spending.
- **Cash Flow Management:** Enhance cash flow forecasting and management to ensure liquidity.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, ASML should consider strategic repositioning, as suggested by Hofer (1980). This involves:

- **Innovation and R&D Investment:** Continue investing in R&D to maintain technological leadership in the semiconductor industry.
- **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets and applications for existing technologies to diversify revenue streams.
