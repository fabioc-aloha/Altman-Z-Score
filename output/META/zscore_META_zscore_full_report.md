## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) has demonstrated strong financial health as indicated by its Z-Score, which has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone" over the past several quarters. The Z-Score trend reflects the company's robust liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio (X1)**: The current ratio has shown a slight decline from 0.241 in Q4 2024 to 0.201 in Q1 2025. Despite this decline, the ratio remains above the critical threshold, indicating that the company can cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.

### Profitability
- **Retained Earnings (X2)**: The retained earnings as a percentage of total assets have remained stable, ranging from 0.331 to 0.371 over the last four quarters. This stability suggests that the company is effectively retaining earnings to support future growth.

### Capital Efficiency
- **EBIT (X3)**: The EBIT as a percentage of total assets has shown a slight increase from 0.066 in Q4 2024 to 0.086 in Q1 2025. This improvement indicates that the company is becoming more efficient in generating earnings from its assets.

### Leverage
- **Equity to Total Liabilities (X4)**: The equity to total liabilities ratio has remained exceptionally high, reflecting a strong capital structure. The ratio increased from 13.147 in Q1 2025 to 14.86 in Q2 2024, indicating a solid buffer against financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained above 16, indicating that META is in a very strong financial position and is unlikely to face bankruptcy in the foreseeable future. This trend suggests that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth opportunities while maintaining financial stability.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, META does not currently require immediate retrenchment due to its strong financial position. However, it is essential to consider long-term repositioning strategies to sustain growth and adapt to market changes.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**: While not necessary, META should monitor operational costs and streamline processes to maintain efficiency. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on cost control during downturns.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**: META should focus on innovation and market expansion. Hofer (1980) suggests that companies in strong positions should invest in strategic renewal to leverage their competitive advantages. This could involve diversifying product offerings and enhancing customer engagement through technological advancements.
