## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) has demonstrated strong financial health as indicated by its Z-Score trend, which consistently remains in the "Safe Zone" (> 2.90) over the past five quarters. This analysis evaluates the company's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, providing a comprehensive view of its financial standing.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio (X1)**: The current ratio has shown a slight decline from 0.241 in Q4 2024 to 0.201 in Q1 2025. While still positive, this trend indicates a need for improved management of current assets relative to current liabilities to ensure sufficient liquidity.

### Profitability
- **Retained Earnings to Total Assets (X2)**: The ratio has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 0.331 and 0.371. This stability reflects a solid retention of earnings, which is crucial for sustaining operations and funding growth.

### Capital Efficiency
- **EBIT to Total Assets (X3)**: This metric has shown minor fluctuations, with a low of 0.066 in Q1 2025 and a high of 0.086 in Q4 2024. While the figures indicate profitability, there is room for improvement in capital utilization to enhance returns.

### Leverage
- **Equity to Total Liabilities (X4)**: The equity ratio has remained robust, ranging from 13.147 to 14.860. This high leverage ratio indicates a strong equity base, reducing the risk of financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained above 16.0, indicating that META is in a strong financial position with low bankruptcy risk. The trend suggests that the company is effectively managing its financial resources, although attention should be paid to liquidity and capital efficiency metrics.

   - **Cost Control**: Review and reduce discretionary spending to maintain profitability during potential market fluctuations.

   - **Investment in Innovation**: Allocate resources towards R&D to foster innovation and maintain competitive advantage, as suggested by Beard (2024).
   - **Market Expansion**: Explore new markets or product lines to diversify revenue streams, aligning with Hoskisson et al. (2004) on corporate restructuring.

### Theoretical Frameworks
