The company operates platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, providing users with social networking, messaging, and content sharing capabilities. Meta competes with other tech giants like Google, Twitter, and TikTok, focusing on user engagement, advertising revenue, and innovative technologies such as augmented and virtual reality.
