## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Financial Health Overview
Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) has demonstrated robust financial health as indicated by its Z-Score, which has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone" over the past five quarters. The Z-Score for Q1 2025 is 16.748, significantly above the safe threshold of 2.90, indicating a low probability of bankruptcy and strong financial stability.

### Key Financial Metrics
- **Liquidity (X1)**: The liquidity ratio (current assets - current liabilities) to total assets has shown a slight decline from 0.241 in Q4 2024 to 0.201 in Q1 2025. This indicates a decrease in short-term liquidity but remains above the critical threshold.
- **Profitability (X3)**: The EBIT to total assets ratio has also decreased from 0.086 in Q4 2024 to 0.066 in Q1 2025, suggesting a slight decline in operational efficiency.
- **Capital Efficiency (X2)**: Retained earnings as a percentage of total assets have remained relatively stable, indicating consistent profitability and reinvestment into the company.
- **Leverage (X4)**: The equity to total liabilities ratio has remained high, reflecting a strong capital structure with minimal reliance on debt.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend indicates that while META is currently in a strong financial position, the slight decline in liquidity and profitability metrics should be monitored closely. This could suggest potential challenges in maintaining growth or managing operational costs effectively.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, a two-phased response is recommended:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**:
   - **Focus**: Cost reduction and efficiency improvements.
   - **Actions**: Streamline operations, reduce discretionary spending, and optimize workforce management.
   - **Theoretical Basis**: According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment is crucial for stabilizing financial performance in the face of declining metrics.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**:
   - **Focus**: Strategic innovation and market repositioning.
   - **Actions**: Invest in new technologies, enhance product offerings, and explore new market segments.
   - **Theoretical Basis**: Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of strategic renewal for long-term sustainability, which aligns with META's need to innovate continuously in a competitive landscape.
