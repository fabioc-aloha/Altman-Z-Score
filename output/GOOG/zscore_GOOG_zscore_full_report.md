## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is robust, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the difference between current assets and current liabilities relative to total assets. The X1 value has consistently remained above 0.14 over the last five quarters, suggesting that the company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its liabilities.

### Profitability
The profitability of the company, represented by the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), shows a slight decline from 0.088 in Q1 2025 to 0.072 in Q4 2024. This indicates a decrease in operational efficiency, which could be a concern if the trend continues. However, the overall profitability remains positive, contributing to a strong Z-Score.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) reflects the company's ability to retain earnings for reinvestment. The values have hovered around 0.54 to 0.55, indicating a stable retention policy. This is a positive sign for long-term growth and sustainability.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) is exceptionally high, with values ranging from 6.555 to 8.296 over the last five quarters. This indicates that Alphabet is significantly less leveraged than many of its peers, which reduces financial risk and enhances stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Alphabet has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 10.247 to 12.742. This indicates a strong financial health status, suggesting that the company is not at risk of bankruptcy in the foreseeable future. The upward trend in the Z-Score over the last five quarters reinforces this positive outlook.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given the slight decline in profitability, immediate actions should focus on cost management and operational efficiency. According to Hofer (1980), turnaround strategies should prioritize stabilizing cash flows and reducing unnecessary expenditures. This may involve:

- **Cost Reduction Initiatives:** Streamlining operations to improve margins.
- **Operational Audits:** Identifying inefficiencies in processes.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Alphabet should consider strategic repositioning to enhance its market position. Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of innovation and market adaptation in corporate turnarounds. Recommended actions include:

- **Investment in R&D:** To foster innovation and maintain competitive advantage.
- **Market Diversification:** Exploring new markets or segments to reduce dependency on core products.
