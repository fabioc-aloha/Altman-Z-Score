## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Baidu's liquidity, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a consistent positive trend, remaining above the threshold of 0.2. This suggests that the company is capable of meeting its short-term obligations, which is a positive indicator of financial health.

### Profitability
The X2 component, representing retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, indicates that Baidu has maintained a stable level of profitability. The slight decrease from 0.421 to 0.390 suggests a need for attention to profitability strategies to ensure sustainable growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component, which measures EBIT relative to total assets, has shown a declining trend. This indicates that while Baidu is generating earnings, the efficiency of asset utilization is decreasing, which could impact future profitability.

### Leverage
The X4 component reflects Baidu's equity relative to its total liabilities. The consistent ratio indicates a stable capital structure, which is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and financial stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
Baidu's Z-Score has consistently remained in the Safe Zone (above 2.90), indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. However, the downward trend in the Z-Score from 3.004 in Q4 2024 to 2.750 in Q4 2025 suggests a need for proactive management to address potential vulnerabilities in profitability and capital efficiency.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
In light of the declining Z-Score trend, immediate retrenchment strategies should be implemented. This includes cost-cutting measures, optimizing operational efficiency, and focusing on core business areas. According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment can stabilize financial performance and provide a foundation for future growth.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Baidu should invest in innovation and technology to enhance its competitive advantage. Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of strategic renewal in turnaround situations. This could involve diversifying product offerings and exploring new markets to drive growth.
