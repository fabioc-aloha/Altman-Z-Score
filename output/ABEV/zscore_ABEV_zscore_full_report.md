## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Ambev S.A. is assessed through the current ratio, which is derived from the X1 component of the Z-Score. The current assets are $43,551 million, while current liabilities are $39,343.5 million, resulting in a current ratio of approximately 1.11. This indicates that Ambev has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities, but the margin is narrow.

### Profitability
Profitability is evaluated through the EBIT to total assets ratio (X3). The EBIT is $5,362.5 million against total assets of $147,299 million, yielding an EBIT margin of approximately 3.64%. This suggests moderate profitability, but the trend over the quarters shows a decline, indicating potential operational inefficiencies or increased costs.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings (X2) as a percentage of total assets is 2.02%, which reflects a low level of reinvestment into the business. This could be a concern for long-term growth and sustainability.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4) shows a market value of equity of $94,528.3 million against total liabilities of $51,823.1 million, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.82. This indicates a relatively healthy leverage position, but the declining trend in the Z-Score suggests increasing financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Ambev has consistently remained in the distress zone, with the latest score at 0.757. This trend indicates a deteriorating financial condition, suggesting that the company is at a high risk of bankruptcy if corrective actions are not taken promptly.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Immediate actions should focus on cost-cutting measures and improving operational efficiency. According to Hofer (1980), turnaround strategies often require drastic measures to stabilize the company. This may include:

- **Reducing operational costs**: Streamlining processes and eliminating non-essential expenditures.
- **Divesting non-core assets**: Selling off underperforming segments to focus on core competencies.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Ambev should consider repositioning strategies, as outlined by Bibeault (1999). This involves:

- **Investing in innovation**: Developing new products or improving existing ones to capture market share.
- **Enhancing marketing strategies**: Focusing on brand loyalty and customer engagement to drive sales.
