## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Infosys, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a consistent upward trend from 0.367 in Q1 2024 to 0.400 in Q2 2025. This suggests that the company maintains a strong liquidity position, which is crucial for meeting short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) has also shown improvement, rising from 0.09 in Q1 2024 to 0.14 in Q2 2025. This indicates that Infosys is effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings before interest and taxes, reflecting a positive trend in operational efficiency.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2: Retained Earnings / Total Assets) has remained stable, hovering around 0.76 to 0.82, indicating that the company is retaining a significant portion of its earnings for reinvestment, which is a positive sign for long-term growth.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4: Equity / Total Liabilities) is notably high, ranging from 11.450 to 12.168, indicating that Infosys is primarily financed through equity rather than debt. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances the companyâ€™s stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 18.268 to 19.120. This indicates a strong financial health status and a low probability of bankruptcy in the near future. The upward trend in the Z-Score reflects effective management practices and operational efficiencies.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
In light of the strong Z-Score, immediate retrenchment is not necessary. However, maintaining operational efficiency is crucial. As per Hofer (1980), companies should focus on cost control and optimizing resource allocation to sustain profitability during economic fluctuations.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Infosys should consider diversifying its service offerings and investing in emerging technologies, aligning with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on innovation as a key driver for corporate turnaround. This approach will not only enhance competitive advantage but also mitigate risks associated with market volatility.
