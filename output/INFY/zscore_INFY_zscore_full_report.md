## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Infosys Limited (INFY) is robust, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. The X1 value of 0.367 suggests that the company has a healthy liquidity ratio, allowing it to meet its short-term obligations comfortably.

### Profitability
The profitability of Infosys is reflected in the X3 component, which measures Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT) relative to total assets. With an X3 value of 0.09, the company demonstrates a reasonable level of profitability, although there is room for improvement to enhance returns on assets.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component, representing retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, stands at 0.76. This high value indicates that Infosys has effectively retained a significant portion of its earnings, which can be reinvested into the business for growth and expansion.

### Leverage
The X4 component, which measures equity relative to total liabilities, is notably high at 12.168. This indicates that Infosys is not heavily leveraged, suggesting a conservative capital structure that minimizes financial risk.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The overall Z-Score of 18.268 places Infosys well within the "Safe Zone" (> 2.6), indicating a low probability of bankruptcy and a strong financial position. The Z-Score trend, as illustrated in the accompanying chart, shows consistent performance over the quarters, reinforcing the company's stability and resilience in the market.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
In light of the financial health assessment, a phased response is recommended, focusing on both immediate retrenchment and long-term repositioning.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment:**
   - **Cost Management:** Implement cost-cutting measures to enhance profitability without compromising service quality. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate corrective actions during financial distress.
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline operations to reduce waste and improve productivity, which is critical during downturns (Hofer, 1980).

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - **Innovation and R&D Investment:** Allocate resources towards innovation and research to maintain competitive advantage, as suggested by Beard (2024).
   - **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets and customer segments to diversify revenue streams, in line with Hoskisson et al. (2004) on strategic renewal.
