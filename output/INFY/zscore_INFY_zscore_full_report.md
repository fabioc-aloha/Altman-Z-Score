## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health
### Liquidity
Infosys has maintained a strong liquidity position, with a current ratio significantly above the industry average, indicating its ability to meet short-term obligations. The quick ratio also reflects a solid liquidity position, suggesting that the company can cover its immediate liabilities without relying on inventory sales.

### Profitability
The company has demonstrated robust profitability metrics, with gross and net margins consistently outperforming industry peers. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are also strong, indicating effective management of resources and shareholder equity.

### Capital Efficiency
Infosys exhibits high capital efficiency, with a favorable asset turnover ratio. This suggests that the company effectively utilizes its assets to generate revenue, a critical factor in maintaining competitive advantage.

### Leverage
The company's debt-to-equity ratio is low, indicating a conservative approach to leveraging. This positions Infosys favorably in terms of financial stability, reducing the risk associated with high debt levels.

### Z-Score Assessment
Based on the Altman Z-Score framework, Infosys is currently in the **Safe Zone**, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. The Z-Score components reflect strong performance across the board, with particularly high scores in profitability and liquidity metrics.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application
Given Infosys's position in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation**: Invest in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance service offerings.
- **Repositioning**: Strengthen the brand's presence in high-growth markets, particularly in digital services and cloud computing.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engage with stakeholders to ensure that strategic initiatives align with their expectations and needs.

The application of Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing suggests that Infosys should prioritize innovation and market expansion while maintaining operational efficiency.
