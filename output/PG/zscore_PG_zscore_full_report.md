## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
P&G's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a negative value, suggesting that current liabilities exceed current assets. This could raise concerns about the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability metric (X3) indicates a positive EBIT relative to total assets, which is a positive sign. However, the low values suggest that there is room for improvement in operational efficiency.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings (X2) component reflects a strong equity position, indicating that the company has been able to reinvest profits effectively over time.

### Leverage
P&G's leverage, represented by the X4 component, is robust, with a high equity-to-liabilities ratio. This indicates a strong capital structure and lower financial risk.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
With a Z-Score of 5.046, P&G is firmly in the **Safe Zone**, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. The trajectory of the Z-Score has remained consistent and strong over the past quarters, suggesting stable financial health.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given P&G's position in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation:** P&G should continue to invest in research and development to enhance product offerings and explore new market opportunities.
- **Repositioning:** The company can leverage its strong brand portfolio to enter emerging markets or diversify into new product categories.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Engaging with stakeholders, including customers and employees, will be crucial for maintaining brand loyalty and operational efficiency.

Theoretical frameworks such as Freeman's stakeholder theory (1984) can guide P&G in aligning its strategies with stakeholder interests to foster long-term growth.
