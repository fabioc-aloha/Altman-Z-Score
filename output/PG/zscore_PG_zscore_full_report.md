## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Procter & Gamble (PG) has shown a negative trend in its liquidity ratio (X1), indicating that current liabilities exceed current assets. This suggests potential short-term liquidity issues, which could impact the company's ability to meet its obligations promptly.

### Profitability
The retained earnings ratio (X2) remains strong, reflecting a solid historical profitability and reinvestment strategy. This is a positive indicator of the companyâ€™s ability to generate profits over time.

### Capital Efficiency
The earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to total assets ratio (X3) indicates a moderate level of operational efficiency. While the ratio is positive, it suggests that there may be room for improvement in asset utilization.

### Leverage
The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is robust, indicating that PG is primarily financed through equity rather than debt. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances stability, especially in volatile market conditions.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a score of 5.046 in Q1 2025. This indicates that PG is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy, but the declining liquidity ratio raises concerns that should be addressed to maintain this status. The trend suggests a need for strategic adjustments to improve liquidity while sustaining profitability and capital efficiency.

   - **Innovation Focus:** Invest in R&D to drive product innovation, aligning with consumer trends and preferences (Beard, 2024).
