## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
Procter & Gamble Company (PG) has demonstrated a strong financial position as indicated by its Z-Score, which has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone" over the last five quarters. The Z-Score trend shows a slight decline from 5.046 in Q1 2025 to 4.761 in Q2 2024, but it remains well above the threshold of 2.99, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy.

### Key Financial Metrics
1. **Liquidity (X1)**: The liquidity ratio (X1) has been negative across the quarters, indicating that current liabilities exceed current assets. This suggests potential liquidity challenges, although the overall Z-Score remains robust due to other strong components.
   
2. **Profitability (X2)**: The retained earnings to total assets ratio (X2) is consistently above 1, reflecting strong profitability and retained earnings growth, which is a positive indicator of the company's ability to reinvest in its operations.

3. **Capital Efficiency (X3)**: The EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) has shown slight fluctuations but remains positive, indicating effective management of assets to generate earnings before interest and taxes.

4. **Leverage (X4)**: The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is significantly high, suggesting that PG is less reliant on debt financing, which reduces financial risk.

5. **Sales Efficiency (X5)**: The sales to total assets ratio (X5) is stable, indicating that the company effectively utilizes its assets to generate sales.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend indicates that while PG is performing well overall, the negative liquidity ratio suggests a need for immediate attention to improve working capital management. The company should focus on strategies to enhance liquidity while maintaining its strong profitability and leverage positions.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Strategy
Based on the analysis, a phased response strategy is recommended, distinguishing between immediate retrenchment and long-term repositioning.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**:
   - **Focus on Liquidity Improvement**: Implement cost-cutting measures and optimize inventory management to improve cash flow. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate actions to stabilize financial health during distress.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**:
   - **Strategic Renewal**: Invest in innovation and marketing to enhance product offerings and market share. This aligns with Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies that advocate for long-term strategic renewal to ensure sustainable growth.
