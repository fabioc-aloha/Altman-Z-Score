## Z-Score Formula Used

Z = 1.20*X1 + 1.40*X2 + 3.30*X3 + 0.60*X4 + 1.00*X5
- X1 = (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets
- X2 = Retained Earnings / Total Assets
- X3 = EBIT / Total Assets
- X4 = Equity / Total Liabilities
- X5 = Sales / Total Assets

**Thresholds:**
- Safe Zone: > 2.99
- Grey Zone: > 1.81 and <= 2.99
- Distress Zone: <= 1.81

# Diagnostic and Strategic Recommendations Report for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC)

## Company Profile
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) is a leading global semiconductor foundry, headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan. Established in 1994, TSMC specializes in manufacturing integrated circuits and provides a wide range of semiconductor services, including design, fabrication, and testing. The company operates in a highly competitive industry, facing rivals such as Samsung Electronics and GlobalFoundries. TSMC is known for its advanced technology and innovation, which positions it as a critical player in the global supply chain for electronics.

The leadership team is headed by Dr. C. C. Wei, who serves as Chairman and CEO, overseeing the strategic direction and operational execution of the company. Other key executives include Mr. Jen-Chau Huang, the CFO, responsible for financial stewardship, and Dr. Y. J. Mii and Mr. Y. P. Chyn, who serve as Co-COOs, managing operations. Notably, there have been no recent significant changes in the executive team, indicating stability in leadership.

Recent news highlights TSMC's ongoing investments in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, to meet increasing global demand for semiconductors. This strategic move is expected to enhance TSMC's competitive edge and mitigate supply chain risks.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health
### Financial Analysis
- **Liquidity**: TSMC maintains a strong liquidity position, with a current ratio significantly above 1, indicating its ability to cover short-term liabilities. The quick ratio also reflects a solid liquidity stance.
- **Profitability**: The company exhibits robust profitability metrics, with high gross and net margins compared to industry averages. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are also strong, showcasing effective asset utilization and shareholder value generation.
- **Capital Efficiency**: TSMC's capital efficiency is commendable, with a favorable asset turnover ratio, indicating effective use of assets to generate revenue.
- **Leverage**: The debt-to-equity ratio is low, suggesting a conservative approach to leveraging, which reduces financial risk.

### Z-Score Assessment
Based on the Altman Z-Score framework, TSMC's Z-Score is well above the threshold of 3, placing it in the **Safe Zone**. This indicates a low risk of bankruptcy and financial distress. The components of the Z-Score, including working capital, retained earnings, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), market value of equity, and total liabilities, all reflect strong financial health.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application
Given TSMC's position in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation**: TSMC should continue investing in R&D to maintain its technological leadership, particularly in advanced nodes and emerging technologies like AI and 5G.
- **Repositioning**: Expanding manufacturing capabilities in strategic locations (e.g., the U.S. and Europe) will not only enhance supply chain resilience but also align with geopolitical trends favoring local production.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engaging with stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and investors, will be crucial in fostering trust and collaboration, especially during expansion phases.

The application of Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing and Freeman's (1984) stakeholder alignment theories will guide TSMC in navigating its growth trajectory effectively.
