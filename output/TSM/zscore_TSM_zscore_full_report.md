# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is assessed through the X1 component of the Z-Score, which indicates the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. The X1 value has shown a slight upward trend from 0.246 in Q1 2024 to 0.266 in Q4 2024, suggesting a modest improvement in liquidity. However, the value remains below the threshold of 0.5, indicating potential liquidity concerns.

### Profitability
Profitability is evaluated using the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets). TSMC's X3 value has decreased from 0.047 in Q1 2024 to 0.064 in Q4 2024, reflecting a slight improvement in operational efficiency. However, the overall profitability remains low, which may hinder the company's ability to generate sufficient returns for stakeholders.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) indicates capital efficiency. TSMC's X2 has shown a gradual increase from 0.569 in Q1 2024 to 0.579 in Q4 2024, suggesting that the company is retaining a larger portion of its earnings relative to its total assets. This is a positive sign for long-term sustainability.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates the company's leverage. TSMC's X4 has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 0.328 and 0.423 over the four quarters, indicating a moderate level of debt relative to its equity. A higher ratio would suggest a stronger equity position, which is crucial for financial stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The overall Z-Score for TSMC has remained in the distress zone, with values ranging from 1.545 to 1.723 over the past four quarters. This consistent positioning below the critical threshold of 1.8 indicates that TSMC is at risk of financial distress. Immediate actions are necessary to improve its financial health.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement cost-cutting measures to improve profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider divesting non-core assets to improve liquidity and reduce debt levels, as suggested by Hofer (1980).
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline operations to enhance productivity and reduce waste, following Hoskisson et al. (2004).

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Diversification:** Explore new markets and product lines to reduce dependency on existing revenue streams, as recommended by Beard (2024).
   - **Innovation Investment:** Increase R&D spending to foster innovation and maintain competitive advantage, aligning with Freeman's (1984) stakeholder approach.
   - **Strategic Partnerships:** Form alliances with technology firms to enhance capabilities and market reach.
