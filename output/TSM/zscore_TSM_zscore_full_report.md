| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |    X3 |    X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic    |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is assessed through the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the net working capital relative to total assets. The X1 value has shown a slight increase from 0.246 in Q1 2024 to 0.266 in Q4 2024. However, it remains below the ideal threshold of 0.2, indicating potential liquidity issues. This suggests that TSMC may struggle to meet short-term obligations, which is critical in the capital-intensive semiconductor industry.

### Profitability
Profitability is evaluated through the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets). The X3 value has decreased from 0.047 in Q1 2024 to 0.064 in Q4 2024, indicating a slight improvement in operational efficiency. However, the overall profitability remains low, which could hinder TSMC's ability to reinvest in growth or pay dividends.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) reflects TSMC's ability to retain earnings for reinvestment. The X2 value has shown a downward trend from 0.569 in Q1 2024 to 0.579 in Q4 2024, indicating a decline in retained earnings relative to total assets. This trend suggests that TSMC may be facing challenges in generating sufficient profits to reinvest in its operations.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates TSMC's leverage position. The X4 value has remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 0.328 to 0.423. While this indicates a moderate level of leverage, it also suggests that TSMC may be relying on debt financing, which can be risky in a volatile market.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The overall Z-Score for TSMC has consistently remained in the distress zone, with values ranging from 1.545 to 1.723 over the last four quarters. This trend indicates a deteriorating financial health and raises concerns about the company's ability to sustain operations without significant restructuring or turnaround strategies.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the diagnostic evaluation, TSMC should adopt a phased response strategy that distinguishes between immediate retrenchment and long-term repositioning.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment:**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the importance of reducing expenses in the early stages of recovery.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to generate cash and improve working capital, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - **Strategic Investment:** Reinvest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage, as highlighted by Hoskisson et al. (2004).
   - **Market Diversification:** Explore new markets or segments to reduce dependency on existing revenue streams, following the principles of strategic renewal outlined by Beard (2024).

## Investor Recommendation
Given TSMC's current financial distress as indicated by the Z-Score below 1.81, investors should **hold** their positions while monitoring the implementation of the turnaround strategy. This recommendation is based on the potential for recovery through strategic actions. However, investors should consult their financial advisors before making any decisions.
