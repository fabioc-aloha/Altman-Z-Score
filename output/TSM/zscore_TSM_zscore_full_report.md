## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is assessed through the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects the working capital ratio. The X1 value has shown a slight upward trend from 0.246 in Q1 2024 to 0.266 in Q4 2024, indicating a marginal improvement in liquidity. However, the value remains below the ideal threshold of 0.5, suggesting that TSMC may face challenges in meeting short-term obligations.

### Profitability
Profitability is evaluated through the X3 component, which measures earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to total assets. The X3 value has decreased from 0.047 in Q1 2024 to 0.064 in Q4 2024, indicating a decline in operational efficiency and profitability. This trend is concerning, as it suggests that TSMC is generating less profit from its assets over time.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component, representing retained earnings as a percentage of total assets, has also shown a downward trend, from 0.569 in Q1 2024 to 0.579 in Q4 2024. This indicates that TSMC's ability to reinvest profits into the business is weakening, which could hinder future growth and innovation.

### Leverage
The X4 component, which measures equity relative to total liabilities, has remained relatively stable, hovering around 0.423 to 0.417. While this indicates a moderate level of leverage, it also suggests that TSMC is not effectively utilizing its equity to reduce debt levels, which could pose risks in a downturn.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The overall Z-Score for TSMC has consistently remained in the distress zone, with values ranging from 1.545 to 1.723 over the last four quarters. This trend indicates a significant risk of financial distress and potential bankruptcy if corrective measures are not taken. The declining profitability and liquidity ratios are particularly alarming and warrant immediate attention.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
To address the financial challenges faced by TSMC, a phased response is proposed, distinguishing between immediate retrenchment and long-term repositioning.

1. **Immediate Retrenchment:**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This may include reducing operational expenses, renegotiating supplier contracts, and freezing hiring.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Evaluate non-core assets for potential sale to generate cash and improve the working capital position.
   - **Debt Restructuring:** Engage with creditors to negotiate more favorable terms or defer payments to alleviate short-term cash flow pressures.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - **Strategic Innovation:** Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage in the semiconductor industry. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on innovation as a key driver of corporate turnaround.
   - **Market Diversification:** Explore new markets and customer segments to reduce dependency on existing revenue streams, as suggested by Hofer (1980).
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster stronger relationships with stakeholders, including customers and suppliers, to enhance collaboration and support for strategic initiatives (Freeman, 1984).
