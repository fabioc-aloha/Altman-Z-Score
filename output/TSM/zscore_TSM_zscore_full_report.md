## Company Profile
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) is a leading global semiconductor foundry headquartered in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The company specializes in manufacturing integrated circuits and provides a range of services including design support, wafer fabrication, and testing. TSMC operates in a highly competitive landscape, with key competitors including Samsung Electronics, Intel, and GlobalFoundries. The company is known for its advanced technology nodes and has a significant market share in the semiconductor industry.

The leadership team is headed by Dr. C. C. Wei, who serves as the Chairman and CEO, overseeing the strategic direction and operational execution of the company. Other key executives include Mr. Jen-Chau Huang, the Senior VP of Finance and CFO, responsible for financial stewardship, and Mr. Y. P. Chyn and Dr. Y. J.

Recent news highlights TSMC's ongoing investments in expanding its manufacturing capabilities, including plans for new facilities in the U.S. and Japan, which may enhance its competitive position in the global market.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health
### Liquidity
TSMC maintains a strong liquidity position, with a current ratio significantly above 1, indicating that it can cover its short-term liabilities comfortably. The quick ratio also reflects a solid liquidity position, suggesting that the company can meet its obligations without relying on inventory sales.

### Profitability
The company exhibits robust profitability metrics, with high gross and net margins compared to industry peers. Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) are also strong, indicating effective management of resources and shareholder equity.

### Capital Efficiency
TSMC's capital efficiency is commendable, with a favorable asset turnover ratio, suggesting that the company effectively utilizes its assets to generate revenue.

### Leverage
The debt-to-equity ratio is low, indicating that TSMC is not overly reliant on debt financing, which reduces financial risk and enhances stability.

### Z-Score Assessment
Based on the Altman Z-Score framework, TSMC's Z-Score is well above the threshold for the Safe Zone, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. The components of the Z-Score, including working capital, retained earnings, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), market value of equity, and total liabilities, all reflect a strong financial position.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application
Given TSMC's position in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. The company should leverage its strong financial health to invest in research and development, enhancing its technological capabilities and product offerings.

Applying Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing, TSMC should prioritize strategic investments in emerging technologies such as AI and 5G, which are expected to drive future growth. Additionally, aligning with Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory, TSMC should engage with its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors, to ensure that their interests are considered in strategic decisions.
