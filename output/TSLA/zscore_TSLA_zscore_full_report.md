## Company Profile

Tesla, Inc. is a leading manufacturer in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, headquartered in Austin, Texas. The company designs, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and energy storage products. Tesla's primary competitors include traditional automotive giants like Ford and General Motors, as well as other EV manufacturers such as Rivian and Lucid Motors. Tesla's product lineup includes the Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y, along with energy solutions like the Powerwall and solar products.

In recent years, Tesla has positioned itself as a pioneer in the EV market, leveraging its innovative technology and strong brand loyalty. The company has experienced significant growth, driven by increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions and advancements in battery technology. Tesla's market capitalization has soared, reflecting investor confidence in its future prospects.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Tesla's liquidity position is robust, as indicated by its current ratio (X1) of 0.237 in Q1 2025. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is essential for maintaining operational stability.

### Profitability
The company's profitability, as measured by retained earnings (X2), stands at 0.285. This indicates a healthy level of retained earnings relative to total assets, reflecting Tesla's ability to generate profits and reinvest in growth.

### Capital Efficiency
Tesla's capital efficiency, represented by EBIT (X3), is relatively low at 0.005. This suggests that while the company is generating revenue, its operational efficiency could be improved to enhance profitability.

### Leverage
Tesla's leverage ratio (X4) is exceptionally strong at 16.798, indicating a high level of equity relative to total liabilities. This positions the company favorably in terms of financial stability and reduces the risk of insolvency.

### Sales Performance
The sales to total assets ratio (X5) is 0.155, which is indicative of a solid sales performance relative to the asset base. This suggests that Tesla is effectively utilizing its assets to generate revenue.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
Tesla's Z-Score has consistently remained in the Safe Zone, with a score of 10.934 in Q1 2025. This reflects a strong financial position, indicating low bankruptcy risk and a solid foundation for future growth.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Tesla's position in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and **stakeholder alignment** for sustained growth.
