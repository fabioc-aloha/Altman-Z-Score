## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (AMC) is currently facing significant liquidity challenges, as indicated by the negative X1 value across all quarters analyzed. This suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets, which raises concerns about the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. A negative X1 value indicates a potential liquidity crisis, which is critical for operational sustainability.

### Profitability
The X2 component, representing retained earnings as a percentage of total assets, is also negative, indicating that AMC has accumulated losses rather than retained earnings. This is a significant red flag, as it suggests that the company has not been able to generate sufficient profits to reinvest in its operations or to provide returns to shareholders.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 value, which measures earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to total assets, is negative in all quarters. This indicates that AMC is not generating positive operating income relative to its asset base, further exacerbating its financial distress.

### Leverage
The X4 component shows a positive value, indicating that equity is greater than total liabilities, which is a favorable sign. However, this alone does not mitigate the overall distress indicated by the other components.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for AMC has consistently remained in the distress zone, with values ranging from -4.109 to -3.274 over the analyzed quarters. This persistent distress signals a critical need for immediate intervention to prevent potential bankruptcy. The trend indicates a worsening financial situation, necessitating urgent strategic actions.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, renegotiation of supplier contracts, and reduction of discretionary spending. This aligns with Bibeault’s (1999) principles of corporate turnaround, emphasizing the need to stabilize cash flow.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Identify non-core assets for sale to improve liquidity. This approach is supported by Hofer’s (1980) turnaround strategies, which advocate for asset management to enhance financial health.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Business Model Innovation:** Explore new revenue streams, such as enhancing digital offerings or partnerships with streaming services. This aligns with Beard’s (2024) emphasis on strategic renewal through innovation.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster relationships with key stakeholders, including investors and customers, to rebuild trust and support. Freeman’s (1984) stakeholder theory highlights the importance of stakeholder management in strategic renewal.
