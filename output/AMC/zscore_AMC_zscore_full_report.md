## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

AMC's financial health is currently in the **Distress Zone**, as indicated by a Z-Score of -4.109. This score suggests significant liquidity issues, negative retained earnings, and high leverage, which are critical factors in assessing the company's financial stability.

- **Liquidity:** The negative X1 value (-0.109) indicates that current liabilities exceed current assets, suggesting a liquidity crisis that could hinder operational capabilities.
- **Profitability:** The negative X2 value (-1.062) reflects accumulated losses, which is alarming for a company reliant on consumer spending and discretionary income.
- **Capital Efficiency:** The X3 value (-0.01) shows that earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are insufficient to cover total assets, indicating poor operational efficiency.
- **Leverage:** The X4 value (0.127) suggests that equity is low relative to total liabilities, raising concerns about the company’s ability to meet long-term obligations.

The trajectory of the Z-Score indicates a consistent decline over the past quarters, reinforcing the urgency for immediate corrective actions.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given AMC's position in the **Distress Zone**, the company must prioritize **urgent retrenchment** strategies. This includes cash preservation measures and negotiations with creditors to restructure debt obligations. 

- **Hofer (1980)** emphasizes the importance of a sequenced approach to turnaround, which AMC must adopt by first stabilizing its cash flow.
- **Bibeault (1999)** highlights the causes of failure, which in AMC's case stem from high operational costs and declining revenues due to competition from streaming services.
- **Hoskisson et al. (2004)** suggest strategic restructuring, which AMC should consider by potentially downsizing underperforming locations and renegotiating lease agreements.
- **Beard (2024)** provides insights into tech-sector renewal, which AMC can leverage by enhancing its digital presence and exploring partnerships with streaming platforms.
- **Freeman (1984)** stresses stakeholder alignment, which is crucial for AMC to maintain investor confidence and customer loyalty during this challenging period.

| Employees | Moderate | Medium | Employee morale and retention are critical during restructuring; their support can influence operational success (Freeman, 1984). |
