## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. has consistently shown negative values for the liquidity ratio (X1), indicating that current liabilities exceed current assets. This trend suggests a potential liquidity crisis, as the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) has also been negative, reflecting that earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are insufficient to cover total assets. This indicates that the company is not generating enough operational income to sustain its asset base, which is a significant concern for stakeholders.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2) is negative, indicating that the company has accumulated losses rather than profits over time. This lack of retained earnings can hinder future growth and investment opportunities, as it reflects a history of operational challenges.

### Leverage
The equity to liabilities ratio (X4) shows a positive value, suggesting that while AMC has some equity cushion, it is still heavily leveraged. The reliance on debt financing can increase financial risk, especially in a volatile market environment.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for AMC has consistently remained in the distress zone, with values significantly below the threshold of 1.23. The trend indicates a worsening financial condition over the past quarters, with the latest Z-Score at -4.109 for Q1 2025. This alarming trend necessitates immediate action to avert potential bankruptcy.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to stabilize cash flow. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) principles of corporate turnaround, emphasizing the need for quick financial stabilization.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to improve liquidity, as suggested by Hofer (1980), who advocates for divesting underperforming segments during a crisis.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new opportunities and threats. Hoskisson et al. (2004) highlight the importance of strategic realignment in corporate restructuring.
   - **Innovation and Diversification:** Invest in innovative technologies and diversify service offerings to attract new customer segments, as recommended by Beard (2024). This can help AMC adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions.
