The X1 value has consistently increased from 0.059 in Q1 2024 to 0.075 in Q1 2025, suggesting improved short-term financial health and the ability to cover current liabilities.

### Profitability
The profitability of MSFT is reflected in its X3 value (EBIT / Total Assets), which has remained stable around 0.057 to 0.059 over the analyzed quarters. This stability indicates that the company is effectively generating earnings from its assets, contributing positively to its overall financial health.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 value (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) shows a gradual increase from 0.329 in Q1 2024 to 0.391 in Q1 2025. This trend indicates that MSFT is retaining a larger portion of its earnings, which can be reinvested into the business for growth and innovation.

### Leverage

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given the strong financial position of MSFT, immediate retrenchment is not necessary. However, it is essential to maintain operational efficiency and cost management to safeguard against potential market fluctuations. Implementing cost-control measures and optimizing operational processes can help sustain profitability.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, MSFT should focus on innovation and market expansion. According to Hofer (1980), strategic renewal is vital for sustaining competitive advantage. MSFT can invest in emerging technologies and diversify its product offerings to capture new market segments. Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of leadership in driving corporate turnaround efforts, suggesting that the executive team should foster a culture of innovation and adaptability.
