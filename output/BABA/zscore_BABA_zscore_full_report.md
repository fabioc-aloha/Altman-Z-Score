# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Liquidity measures the company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. A high current ratio indicates strong liquidity, while a low ratio suggests potential cash flow issues. For Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA), we will analyze the current assets and current liabilities to assess liquidity.

### Profitability
Profitability ratios, such as EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) to total assets, indicate how efficiently the company generates profit relative to its asset base. A higher EBIT suggests better profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
Capital efficiency is assessed through retained earnings relative to total assets. This ratio reflects how well the company utilizes its equity to generate profits. A higher ratio indicates effective capital management.

### Leverage
Leverage is evaluated through the market value of equity relative to total liabilities. A high leverage ratio indicates that the company relies heavily on debt financing, which can be risky if not managed properly.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Altman Z-Score is a predictive measure of corporate bankruptcy risk. A Z-Score above 3 indicates financial stability, while a score below 1.8 suggests a high risk of bankruptcy. The trend of the Z-Score over recent quarters will provide insights into the company's financial trajectory.

   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to raise capital quickly, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - **Strategic Renewal:** Focus on innovation and market repositioning to enhance competitive advantage, drawing from Beard’s (2024) insights on agile practices.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster relationships with key stakeholders to align interests and support long-term strategies, as Freeman (1984) advocates.
