# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Sea Limited (SE)

---
## Company Profile
Sea Limited, headquartered in Singapore, operates primarily in the technology and e-commerce sectors. The company is known for its digital entertainment platform Garena, its e-commerce platform Shopee, and its digital financial services through SeaMoney. Competitors include major players like Alibaba, Tencent, and Amazon, which operate in similar markets across Southeast Asia and beyond. 

In recent years, Sea Limited has expanded its footprint in the digital economy, leveraging its platforms to cater to a growing customer base in the region. The company has seen significant growth in its e-commerce segment, particularly during the pandemic, which has accelerated the shift towards online shopping. However, it faces challenges such as intense competition, regulatory scrutiny, and the need for continuous innovation to maintain its market position.

Overall, Sea Limited is positioned as a leading player in the Southeast Asian digital landscape, with a diverse portfolio that includes gaming, e-commerce, and financial services. The company's recent financial performance indicates a strong trajectory, as reflected in its Altman Z-Score, which places it in the Safe Zone.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health
### Liquidity
Sea Limited exhibits a strong liquidity position, as indicated by its X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, which has consistently remained above 0.2 across the quarters analyzed. This suggests that the company is well-positioned to meet its short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability aspect, represented by the X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets), shows a slight decline, indicating that while the company is generating earnings, the efficiency relative to its asset base is decreasing. This could be a point of concern if not addressed.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) reflects negative retained earnings, which is a significant concern. This indicates that the company has accumulated losses over time, impacting its overall financial stability.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities) shows a robust leverage position, with values consistently above 2.0. This indicates that Sea Limited has a strong equity base relative to its liabilities, reducing financial risk.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score has shown a positive trajectory, moving from the Grey Zone in 2024 Q1 (2.388) to the Safe Zone in 2025 Q1 (5.811). This upward trend indicates improved financial health and stability, positioning Sea Limited favorably against potential bankruptcy risks.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)
Given that Sea Limited is in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on sustaining growth and innovation. 

- **Innovation and Repositioning**: The company should invest in new technologies and enhance its service offerings to maintain competitive advantage. This aligns with Beard's (2024) emphasis on tech-sector renewal.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engaging stakeholders effectively is crucial. Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory suggests that aligning interests can lead to better outcomes for all parties involved.
- **Strategic Investments**: Allocate resources towards expanding the e-commerce platform and enhancing digital financial services, which can drive revenue growth and market share.
