## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Financial Analysis

- **Liquidity:** The current ratio (X1) is negative, indicating that current liabilities exceed current assets. This raises concerns about short-term liquidity.
- **Profitability:** The EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) shows a positive trend, suggesting that the company is generating earnings efficiently relative to its asset base.
- **Capital Efficiency:** Retained earnings (X2) are negative, which may indicate challenges in retaining profits for reinvestment.
- **Leverage:** The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is strong, suggesting that the company is well-capitalized and has a solid equity base to support its operations.

### Z-Score Trajectory

The Z-Score for Apple Inc. has consistently remained in the **Safe Zone**, with the latest score at 7.941. This indicates a strong financial position and low risk of bankruptcy. The trajectory shows stability and resilience, with no significant fluctuations over the past quarters.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Apple Inc.'s position in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and aligning with stakeholders for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation:** Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and explore new markets.
- **Repositioning:** Consider strategic partnerships or acquisitions to expand the product ecosystem.
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Engage with shareholders, customers, and employees to ensure alignment with the company’s long-term vision.

The application of Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing suggests that Apple should prioritize innovation as a means of maintaining competitive advantage, while Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory emphasizes the importance of aligning interests across all parties involved.
