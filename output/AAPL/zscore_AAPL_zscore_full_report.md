## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Apple Inc. has shown a consistent negative trend in its liquidity ratios, particularly in the current assets to current liabilities ratio (X1). This indicates that the company may face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations. The negative values suggest that current liabilities exceed current assets, which could lead to liquidity issues if not addressed.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) indicates that Apple is generating earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to its total assets. The values are positive, suggesting that the company is effectively utilizing its assets to generate profit. However, the declining trend in X3 over the quarters indicates a potential concern for future profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings to total assets ratio (X2) is negative, which reflects a decrease in retained earnings relative to total assets. This could indicate that Apple is either not reinvesting enough of its profits back into the business or is facing challenges in maintaining profitability.

### Leverage
The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) remains strong, indicating that Apple has a solid capital structure with a high level of equity compared to its liabilities. This suggests that the company is less reliant on debt financing, which is a positive sign for long-term financial health.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Apple has remained in the "Safe Zone" throughout the quarters analyzed, with values significantly above the threshold of 2.99. This indicates that, despite some liquidity and profitability concerns, Apple is not currently at risk of bankruptcy. However, the declining trends in liquidity and profitability metrics warrant attention and proactive management to ensure sustained financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on the findings, immediate actions should focus on improving liquidity and profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the need for immediate cost-cutting measures and operational efficiency improvements. Key actions may include:

- **Cost Reduction Initiatives:** Identify non-essential expenditures and streamline operations to improve cash flow.
- **Inventory Management:** Optimize inventory levels to free up cash and improve liquidity.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Apple should consider repositioning strategies as outlined by Hofer (1980) and Hoskisson et al. (2004). This could involve:

- **Innovation and Product Development:** Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage.
- **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets or segments to diversify revenue streams and reduce dependency on existing products.
