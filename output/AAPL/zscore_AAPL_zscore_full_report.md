Apple Inc. is currently positioned in the **Safe Zone** according to the Altman Z-Score framework, indicating a low risk of bankruptcy. The Z-Score components reveal strong liquidity, profitability, and capital efficiency metrics. 

- **Liquidity**: The current ratio and quick ratio are well above industry averages, suggesting robust short-term financial health.
- **Profitability**: Apple boasts impressive gross and net margins, with a return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) that significantly outperform peers.
- **Capital Efficiency**: The company maintains a low debt-to-equity ratio, indicating prudent leverage management.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application
