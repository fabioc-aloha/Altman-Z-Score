## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Apple Inc. has shown a consistent negative trend in its liquidity ratios, particularly in the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the difference between current assets and current liabilities relative to total assets. This indicates that while Apple maintains a strong overall asset base, its short-term liquidity position is under pressure. 

### Profitability
The X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets) reflects Apple's ability to generate earnings from its assets. The recent quarters show a stable EBIT margin, suggesting that profitability remains robust despite liquidity challenges.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) has been negative, indicating that retained earnings are not contributing positively to the asset base. This could be a concern for long-term growth and reinvestment strategies.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) is exceptionally high, reflecting a strong equity position relative to liabilities. This suggests that Apple is not overly reliant on debt financing, which is a positive indicator of financial stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone" (above 2.99), indicating that Apple is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy. However, the declining trend in liquidity and retained earnings warrants attention. The Z-Score of 7.941 in Q1 2025 reflects strong financial health, but the underlying liquidity issues could pose risks if not addressed.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, Apple should focus on immediate retrenchment measures to stabilize its liquidity position. This includes:
- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing cost-cutting measures in non-essential areas to improve cash flow.
- **Asset Management:** Reviewing and potentially liquidating underperforming assets to bolster cash reserves.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Apple should consider repositioning strategies as outlined by Bibeault (1999) and Hoskisson et al. (2004):
- **Innovation Focus:** Investing in R&D to drive new product development and market expansion.
- **Market Diversification:** Exploring new markets and customer segments to reduce dependency on existing product lines.
