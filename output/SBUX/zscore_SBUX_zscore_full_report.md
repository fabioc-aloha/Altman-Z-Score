# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) has shown a negative trend in liquidity, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which represents the working capital ratio. The current assets have consistently been lower than current liabilities, leading to a negative X1 value across the quarters analyzed. This indicates potential liquidity issues, as the company may struggle to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability of Starbucks is reflected in the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), which has remained low but positive. This suggests that while the company is generating some earnings before interest and taxes, it is not sufficient to offset the negative retained earnings (X2), which have been consistently negative. This indicates that the company has accumulated losses over time, impacting overall profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X4 component (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities) shows a relatively stable ratio, indicating that the market perceives the company as having a significant equity cushion relative to its liabilities. However, the negative retained earnings (X2) and the overall financial distress reflected in the Z-Score indicate that capital efficiency is not translating into sustainable profitability.

### Leverage
The leverage aspect, represented by the X4 component, indicates that Starbucks has a manageable level of debt relative to its market capitalization. However, the overall high total liabilities compared to the negative equity position suggests that the company is heavily leveraged, which poses risks in times of financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Starbucks has remained in the distress zone (below 1.81) across the quarters analyzed, with a slight fluctuation but no significant improvement. The Z-Score of 1.559 in Q1 2025 indicates that the company is at a high risk of bankruptcy, necessitating immediate action to improve financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980) and Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment strategies should focus on cost-cutting measures and liquidity improvement. Starbucks should consider the following actions:
- **Cost Reduction:** Implement a company-wide cost reduction program, focusing on non-essential expenditures.
- **Asset Liquidation:** Evaluate underperforming assets for potential sale to improve liquidity.
- **Debt Restructuring:** Engage with creditors to negotiate more favorable terms or debt forgiveness.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Hoskisson et al. (2004) suggest a focus on strategic renewal. Starbucks should:
- **Market Repositioning:** Innovate product offerings and enhance customer experience to regain market share.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Invest in technology to streamline operations and reduce costs.
- **Brand Revitalization:** Launch a marketing campaign to strengthen brand loyalty and attract new customers.
