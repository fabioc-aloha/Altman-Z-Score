# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Hurco Companies, Inc. is reflected in the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the working capital relative to total assets. The X1 value has remained stable around 0.67 to 0.68 over the last four quarters, indicating a strong liquidity position. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is a positive sign for short-term financial health.

### Profitability
The profitability of the company is assessed through the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets). The negative EBIT values across the quarters indicate that the company is currently unprofitable, with a significant decline in earnings. This trend is concerning and suggests that operational efficiency needs to be addressed to improve profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) shows a consistent ratio around 0.60 to 0.61, indicating that the company has retained a significant portion of its earnings relative to its total assets. This reflects a solid capital efficiency, as the company is reinvesting its earnings into its operations.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates a strong leverage position with values above 2.0, suggesting that the company has a good market capitalization relative to its liabilities. This is a positive indicator of financial stability and suggests that the company is not overly reliant on debt.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has fluctuated between 2.78 and 3.27 over the last four quarters, indicating that the company is in the "Safe Zone" for the most recent quarter (2025 Q1) but has dipped into the "Grey Zone" in earlier quarters. This trend suggests that while the company is currently stable, there are underlying profitability issues that need to be addressed to maintain its financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on the financial analysis, immediate actions should focus on cost-cutting measures and operational efficiency improvements. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the need for immediate corrective actions in response to financial distress.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Hurco should consider strategic repositioning, including exploring new markets or product lines, as suggested by Hofer (1980). This could involve investing in R&D to innovate and diversify its product offerings, thereby enhancing profitability and market competitiveness.
