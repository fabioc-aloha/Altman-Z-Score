# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI) demonstrates a strong liquidity position, with a current ratio (X1) of 0.269 in Q1 2025, indicating that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. This is an improvement from previous quarters, suggesting effective management of short-term assets and liabilities.

### Profitability
The retained earnings (X2) as a percentage of total assets stand at 53.4% in Q1 2025, reflecting a solid profitability trend. This indicates that the company has retained a significant portion of its earnings, which can be reinvested for growth or used to buffer against future downturns.

### Capital Efficiency
The EBIT to total assets ratio (X3) is low at 3.4% in Q1 2025, which may suggest that while the company is profitable, it could improve its operational efficiency. This is a critical area for potential enhancement, as higher capital efficiency can lead to better returns on investment.

### Leverage
The market value of equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is notably high at 7.909 in Q1 2025, indicating that the company is not heavily leveraged and has a strong equity cushion. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances the company's ability to weather economic downturns.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a score of 6.189 in Q1 2025, up from 4.797 in Q1 2024. This upward trend suggests improving financial health and stability, indicating that OLLI is well-positioned to avoid bankruptcy in the near term. The company has effectively managed its financial resources, leading to a robust position relative to its liabilities.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the current financial health and Z-Score trend, a two-phased response is recommended:

#### Immediate Retrenchment
- **Focus on Cost Control:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to enhance profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on addressing operational inefficiencies during the initial turnaround phase.
- **Cash Flow Management:** Prioritize cash flow management to ensure liquidity. This is crucial for maintaining operations and meeting short-term obligations.

#### Long-Term Repositioning
- **Strategic Investment in Growth Areas:** Following the immediate retrenchment, invest in high-potential growth areas, such as e-commerce and customer experience enhancements. This aligns with Hofer's (1980) strategic renewal framework, which emphasizes the importance of innovation and market responsiveness.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster stronger relationships with stakeholders, particularly customers and suppliers, to enhance brand loyalty and operational efficiency. Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory supports this approach, highlighting the importance of stakeholder engagement in strategic management.
