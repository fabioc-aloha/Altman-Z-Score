## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
NIO's liquidity position is concerning, as indicated by the negative values for X1 (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets. This suggests that the company is struggling to meet its short-term obligations, which is a critical warning sign for potential bankruptcy.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics are also alarming, with negative EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) reflected in X3. This indicates that the company is not generating sufficient operational income to cover its costs, further exacerbating its financial distress.

### Capital Efficiency
The negative retained earnings (X2) signal that NIO has accumulated losses over time, which diminishes its equity base and raises concerns about its long-term viability.

### Leverage
The equity to liabilities ratio (X4) is low, suggesting high leverage. This means that NIO is heavily reliant on debt financing, which increases its financial risk, especially in a downturn.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend indicates that NIO is firmly in the distress zone, with scores consistently below 1.81. This trend highlights a deteriorating financial condition, necessitating immediate action to avert potential bankruptcy.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment**
   - **Cost-Cutting Measures:** Implement immediate cost reductions across all departments, focusing on non-essential expenditures. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Evaluate and sell non-core assets to improve liquidity, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**
   - **Strategic Refocus:** Shift focus towards profitable product lines and markets, leveraging Hoskisson et al.'s (2004) principles of corporate restructuring.
   - **Innovation and R&D Investment:** Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and competitiveness, as outlined by Beard (2024).
