## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Coca-Cola's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a positive trend, with values ranging from 0.007 to 0.023 over the last four quarters. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, indicating a stable liquidity position.

### Profitability
The profitability aspect, represented by the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), remains low, with values between 0.032 and 0.044. This indicates that while Coca-Cola generates revenue, its operational efficiency in converting assets into earnings could be improved.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) reflects a strong capital efficiency, with values consistently above 0.715. This indicates that Coca-Cola has effectively retained earnings, contributing positively to its overall asset base.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) shows a robust leverage position, with values ranging from 3.586 to 4.168. This indicates that Coca-Cola has a strong equity base relative to its liabilities, suggesting lower financial risk.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
Coca-Cola's Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with the latest score at 3.845. This trend indicates that the company is financially healthy and not at immediate risk of bankruptcy. The upward trajectory of the Z-Score over the past quarters suggests effective management and operational stability.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given Coca-Cola's strong financial position, immediate retrenchment may not be necessary. However, the company should focus on optimizing operational efficiencies to improve profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) corporate turnaround strategies, which emphasize the need for operational improvements in financially stable firms.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Coca-Cola should consider diversifying its product offerings and investing in healthier beverage options, as consumer preferences shift towards wellness. This approach is supported by Hofer's (1980) strategic renewal framework, which advocates for innovation and adaptation in response to market changes.
