## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) has shown negative values for X1 (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, indicating a liquidity issue. This suggests that the company may struggle to cover its short-term obligations, which is critical for maintaining operational stability.

### Profitability
The retained earnings ratio (X2) is low, reflecting limited profitability over time. This could indicate that the company has not been able to reinvest adequately in its operations or return value to shareholders.

### Capital Efficiency
The EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) to Total Assets ratio (X3) is also low, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient earnings from its asset base. This inefficiency can hinder growth and investment opportunities.

### Leverage
The equity to liabilities ratio (X4) is relatively better, but still concerning, as it indicates that a significant portion of the company's financing comes from debt. This high leverage can increase financial risk, especially in a volatile market.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the distress zone (below 1.81) over the last four quarters, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy. The downward trend in the Z-Score from 0.508 in Q1 2025 to 0.415 in Q1 2024 suggests worsening financial health. This trend necessitates immediate action to stabilize the company.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational costs during a crisis.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to generate cash. This is supported by Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, which advocate for asset management during distress.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify growth opportunities and potential areas for divestment. Hoskisson et al. (2004) highlight the importance of strategic realignment in corporate restructuring.
   - **Innovation and Investment:** Invest in renewable energy technologies to align with market trends and regulatory demands. Beard (2024) discusses the need for strategic renewal through innovation in technology firms.
