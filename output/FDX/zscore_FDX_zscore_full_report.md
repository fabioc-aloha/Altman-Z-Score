# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Financial Health Overview
The Altman Z-Score for FedEx Corporation (FDX) indicates a consistent trend within the "Distress Zone," with scores ranging from 1.55 to 1.73 over the last five quarters. This suggests significant financial distress and a heightened risk of bankruptcy. 

### Key Financial Metrics
- **Liquidity**: The current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) is approximately 1.24 (17,214 / 13,896), indicating that FedEx can cover its short-term liabilities but is operating close to the minimum threshold.
- **Profitability**: The EBIT margin is low, with EBIT at 1,471 million against total revenue of 22,160 million, reflecting challenges in maintaining profitability.
- **Capital Efficiency**: The retained earnings to total assets ratio (X2) is around 0.467, indicating that a significant portion of the company's assets is financed through retained earnings, which is a positive sign but also reflects limited growth.
- **Leverage**: The market value of equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is 1.074, suggesting that FedEx has a relatively stable equity base compared to its liabilities, but the declining trend in Z-Score indicates increasing leverage concerns.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The declining Z-Score trend over the past quarters highlights worsening financial conditions. The company is at risk of entering bankruptcy if corrective measures are not implemented promptly. The consistent presence in the distress zone signals the need for immediate strategic interventions.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Strategy
Based on turnaround management theories (Hofer, 1980; Bibeault, 1999), a phased response is essential for FedEx:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**:
   - **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures, including workforce optimization and operational efficiency improvements.
   - **Asset Liquidation**: Identify non-core assets for divestiture to improve liquidity.
   - **Debt Restructuring**: Engage with creditors to negotiate better terms or defer payments.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**:
   - **Market Reassessment**: Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify growth opportunities and potential shifts in service offerings.
   - **Innovation and Technology Investment**: Invest in technology to enhance operational efficiency and customer service.
   - **Brand Rebuilding**: Focus on marketing strategies that reinforce FedEx's commitment to reliability and service quality.
