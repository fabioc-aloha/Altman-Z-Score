# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: The current assets of FedEx Corporation (FDX) are $17,214 million, while current liabilities are $13,896 million. This results in a current ratio of approximately 1.24, indicating that the company has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, this ratio is relatively low, suggesting potential liquidity concerns.

### Profitability
- **EBIT Margin**: The EBIT for Q1 2025 is $1,471 million against total revenue of $22,160 million, yielding an EBIT margin of approximately 6.64%. This margin indicates moderate profitability but shows a decline from previous quarters, reflecting potential operational inefficiencies.

### Capital Efficiency
- **Asset Turnover**: The sales to total assets ratio (X5) is 0.261, indicating that FedEx generates $0.261 in sales for every dollar of assets. This is a relatively low figure, suggesting that the company may not be utilizing its assets as efficiently as possible.

### Leverage
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: The market value of equity is $26,708 million, while total liabilities are $58,335 million, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 2.18. This high leverage indicates significant financial risk, as the company relies heavily on debt financing.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for FedEx has been consistently below the threshold of 1.8, indicating that the company is in the "Distress Zone." The Z-Score has shown slight fluctuations, with a score of 1.663 in Q1 2025, down from 1.728 in Q4 2024. This downward trend suggests deteriorating financial health and increasing risk of bankruptcy (Altman, 1968).

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**:
   - **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation**: Identify non-core assets for sale to generate cash. Hoskisson et al. (2004) suggest that divesting underperforming assets can enhance financial flexibility.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**:
   - **Operational Efficiency**: Invest in technology to enhance operational efficiency and reduce costs over time. Beard (2024) highlights the importance of innovation in achieving sustainable growth.
   - **Market Expansion**: Explore new markets and service offerings to diversify revenue streams. Hofer (1980) emphasizes the need for strategic renewal to adapt to changing market conditions.
