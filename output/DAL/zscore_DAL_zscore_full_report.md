# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) exhibits a concerning liquidity position, as indicated by the negative values of X1 (Working Capital / Total Assets). The current assets are significantly lower than current liabilities, suggesting that the company may struggle to meet short-term obligations. This trend has persisted over the last five quarters, indicating a systemic liquidity issue.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT / Total Assets), show minimal earnings relative to total assets. The EBIT has been fluctuating, with a notable decline in recent quarters, which raises concerns about the company's operational efficiency and ability to generate profits from its asset base.

### Capital Efficiency
X2 (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) reflects a modest retention of earnings, but the overall trend indicates that retained earnings are not growing sufficiently to support long-term sustainability. This is compounded by the declining EBIT, which suggests that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate returns.

### Leverage
X4 (Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities) indicates a relatively stable leverage position, but the overall market value of equity is under pressure due to the low Z-Score. The company’s reliance on debt financing may pose risks if operational performance does not improve.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Distress Zone" (Z-Score < 1.8) over the last five quarters, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy. The slight upward trend from 0.322 in Q1 2024 to 0.353 in Q1 2025 is insufficient to suggest a turnaround. The company must take immediate action to address its financial health.

## 2. Proposed Phased Response

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, immediate retrenchment is necessary to stabilize the company. This includes:
- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing aggressive cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions and operational efficiencies.
- **Asset Liquidation:** Selling non-core assets to improve liquidity and reduce debt levels.

### Long-Term Repositioning
Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of strategic renewal for long-term success. DAL should focus on:
- **Market Reassessment:** Evaluating market conditions and customer preferences to realign service offerings.
- **Innovation in Services:** Investing in technology and customer experience enhancements to regain market share.
- **Strategic Partnerships:** Forming alliances with other airlines or travel companies to expand reach and improve service offerings.
