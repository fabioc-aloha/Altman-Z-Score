# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Carvana Co. (CVNA)

---
## Company Profile

Carvana Co. (CVNA) is a leading online platform for buying and selling used cars, headquartered in Tempe, Arizona. The company operates in the retail automotive sector, specifically focusing on the digital transformation of the car buying experience. Carvana allows customers to browse, purchase, and finance vehicles online, offering home delivery and a unique car vending machine experience. Competitors include traditional dealerships, online platforms like Vroom and CarGurus, and other e-commerce automotive services.

In recent years, Carvana has experienced significant growth, driven by the increasing consumer preference for online shopping and the convenience of home delivery. However, the company has faced challenges related to profitability and operational efficiency, particularly in the context of rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Carvana's liquidity position, indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a healthy ratio of 0.427 in Q1 2025, suggesting that the company can meet its short-term obligations. This is an improvement from previous quarters, indicating effective management of working capital.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) reflects a modest performance, with a value of 0.058 in Q1 2025. While this is an improvement from earlier quarters, it still highlights the need for enhanced operational efficiency to drive profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2: Retained Earnings / Total Assets) has shown a decline, indicating that Carvana has been reinvesting less of its earnings back into the business. This could be a concern for long-term growth and sustainability.

### Leverage
Carvana's leverage, represented by X4 (Equity / Total Liabilities), is strong at 3.441 in Q1 2025. This suggests that the company has a solid equity base relative to its debt, which is a positive indicator of financial stability.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Carvana has fluctuated over the past quarters, moving from the Distress Zone (1.405) in Q1 2024 to the Safe Zone (3.056) in Q1 2025. This trajectory indicates a significant recovery in financial health, attributed to improved liquidity and leverage ratios. However, the company remains in the Grey Zone for Q4 2024, suggesting that while recovery is underway, vigilance is necessary to maintain this positive trend.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given that Carvana is currently in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth.

- **Innovation**: Invest in technology to enhance the online buying experience, streamline operations, and improve customer service.
- **Repositioning**: Explore new market segments or geographical areas to expand the customer base.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engage with shareholders and customers to align business strategies with their expectations and needs.

Relevant theoretical frameworks include:
- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the importance of innovation in turnaround strategies.
- **Freeman (1984)**: Highlights stakeholder alignment as a critical factor for sustainable growth.
