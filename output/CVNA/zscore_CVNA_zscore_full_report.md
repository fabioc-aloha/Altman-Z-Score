# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Carvana Co. (CVNA)

---
## Company Profile

Carvana Co. (CVNA) is a prominent player in the automotive retail sector, specializing in the online sale of used vehicles. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in Tempe, Arizona, Carvana has revolutionized the car buying experience by allowing customers to purchase vehicles entirely online, complemented by a unique vehicle delivery service. The company operates in a competitive landscape that includes traditional dealerships, online marketplaces, and emerging tech-driven automotive platforms. Key competitors include Vroom, CarGurus, and traditional auto dealerships that are increasingly adopting digital sales strategies.

In recent years, Carvana has faced significant challenges, including fluctuating demand, operational inefficiencies, and financial pressures, particularly during economic downturns. The company's innovative approach to vehicle sales has garnered attention, but it must navigate a complex market environment characterized by changing consumer preferences and economic uncertainties.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Carvana's liquidity position, as indicated by its X1 score, shows a positive trend, moving from 0.280 in Q1 2024 to 0.427 in Q1 2025. This improvement suggests that the company is better positioned to cover its short-term liabilities, although it remains below the industry average.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT/Total Assets), indicate a modest recovery, with a score of 0.058 in Q1 2025. However, this remains a concern as it reflects ongoing challenges in generating sufficient earnings relative to asset utilization.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 score, which measures retained earnings relative to total assets, has shown a decline, indicating that Carvana's ability to reinvest profits into the business is weakening. The negative values in recent quarters highlight the need for strategic adjustments to improve profitability.

### Leverage
Carvana's leverage, as indicated by X4 (Equity/Total Liabilities), remains strong at 3.441 in Q1 2025, suggesting that the company has a solid equity base relative to its debt. This is a positive indicator of financial stability.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score has fluctuated, moving from the distress zone (1.405) in Q1 2024 to the safe zone (3.056) in Q1 2025. This upward trajectory indicates a significant improvement in financial health, but the company must maintain this momentum to ensure long-term sustainability.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Carvana's current Z-Score status in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and **stakeholder alignment** for sustained growth. 

### Strategic Recommendations:
- **Innovation**: Invest in technology to enhance the online buying experience, streamline operations, and improve customer service.
- **Repositioning**: Explore partnerships with financial institutions to offer competitive financing options, making it easier for customers to purchase vehicles.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engage with shareholders and employees to foster a culture of transparency and collaboration, ensuring that all parties are aligned with the company's strategic goals.

### Theoretical Frameworks:
- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the importance of innovation in turnaround strategies, which is crucial for Carvana to differentiate itself in a competitive market.
- **Freeman (1984)**: Highlights the need for stakeholder alignment, which is essential for maintaining investor confidence and employee morale.
