## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
Carvana Co. (CVNA) has shown a fluctuating financial health status over the past few quarters, as indicated by its Z-Score trend. The Z-Score is a crucial metric for assessing the likelihood of bankruptcy, with scores above 2.99 indicating financial stability, scores between 1.81 and 2.99 suggesting caution, and scores below 1.81 indicating distress.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio (X1)**: The current ratio has improved from 0.280 in Q1 2024 to 0.427 in Q1 2025, indicating a better ability to cover short-term liabilities with short-term assets. However, it remains below the ideal threshold of 1.0, suggesting liquidity issues persist.

### Profitability
- **Retained Earnings (X2)**: The negative retained earnings signal ongoing operational losses. The decline from -0.229 in Q1 2024 to -0.135 in Q1 2025 indicates a slight improvement, but the company is still not retaining profits, which is a critical concern for long-term viability.

### Capital Efficiency
- **EBIT (X3)**: The EBIT margin has remained low, reflecting challenges in generating operating income relative to total assets. The slight increase from 0.032 to 0.058 suggests some operational improvements, but profitability remains a significant hurdle.

### Leverage
- **Equity to Liabilities (X4)**: The equity ratio has remained robust, increasing from 1.409 to 3.441, indicating that the company is less leveraged and has a strong equity base relative to its liabilities. This is a positive sign, as it suggests a lower risk of insolvency in the face of financial distress.

### Sales Efficiency
- **Sales to Assets (X5)**: The sales efficiency has shown slight fluctuations but remains relatively stable. The increase from 0.438 to 0.477 indicates a marginal improvement in generating sales from assets.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has improved from a distress zone score of 1.405 in Q1 2024 to a safe zone score of 3.056 in Q1 2025. This upward trend is encouraging, but the company must continue to address its profitability and liquidity issues to maintain and improve its financial health.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Strategy
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**:
   - **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational costs during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation**: Identify non-core assets for sale to generate cash, as suggested by Hofer (1980) in turnaround strategies.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**:
   - **Market Reassessment**: Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new opportunities and customer segments, following Hoskisson et al. (2004) on strategic restructuring.
   - **Innovation and Technology Investment**: Invest in technology to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience, as highlighted by Beard (2024) regarding strategic renewal in technology firms.
