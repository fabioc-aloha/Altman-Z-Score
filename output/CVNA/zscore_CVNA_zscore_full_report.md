## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Financial Analysis

- **Liquidity:** Carvana's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a healthy ratio of 0.427 in Q1 2025, suggesting the company can cover its short-term obligations effectively.
  
- **Profitability:** The profitability measure (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) is relatively low at 0.058, indicating that while Carvana is generating some earnings, it may not be maximizing its asset utilization compared to industry benchmarks.

- **Capital Efficiency:** The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is negative (-0.135), which raises concerns about the company's ability to reinvest profits into growth, reflecting potential challenges in retaining earnings.

- **Leverage:** The leverage ratio (X4: Equity / Total Liabilities) is strong at 3.441, indicating that Carvana has a solid capital structure with more equity than debt, which is a positive sign for financial stability.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status

Carvana's Z-Score has shown a positive trajectory, moving from the Distress Zone (1.405) in Q1 2024 to the Safe Zone (3.056) in Q1 2025. This improvement reflects effective management strategies and operational adjustments that have enhanced financial health. The current Z-Score indicates that Carvana is in the Safe Zone, suggesting a lower risk of bankruptcy and a more stable financial outlook.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Carvana's current status in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and **stakeholder alignment** for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation:** Emphasizing technological advancements in the online car-buying experience can help Carvana maintain its competitive edge. This aligns with Beard's (2024) insights on tech-sector renewal.

- **Repositioning:** Carvana should consider expanding its product offerings or enhancing customer service to attract a broader customer base, leveraging Hoskisson et al. (2004) on strategic restructuring.

- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Engaging with stakeholders, including customers and investors, to ensure their needs and expectations are met will foster loyalty and support, as highlighted by Freeman (1984).
