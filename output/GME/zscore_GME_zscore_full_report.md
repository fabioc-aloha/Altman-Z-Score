| Quarter   |    X1 |     X2 |     X3 |     X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic   |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025 Q1   | 0.798 | -0.014 |  0.014 | 12.725 | 0.218 |     8.837 | Safe Zone    |
| 2024 Q4   | 0.725 | -0.034 | -0.004 |  6.91  | 0.138 |     5.093 | Safe Zone    |

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
GameStop's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a strong trend with values consistently above 0.3, peaking at 0.798 in Q1 2025. This indicates that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, suggesting a robust short-term financial health.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) has shown fluctuations, with a slight negative value in Q4 2024 (-0.004) and Q3 2024 (-0.004). However, it rebounded to a positive value of 0.014 in Q1 2025. This indicates that while profitability has been inconsistent, recent trends suggest a potential recovery.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings (X2) component remains negative, indicating that GameStop has not retained profits over time. This could be a concern for long-term sustainability, as it implies that the company has been operating at a loss historically.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4) is exceptionally high, with values reaching 12.725 in Q1 2025. This indicates that GameStop has a strong equity position relative to its liabilities, which is a positive sign for creditors and investors.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has remained in the "Safe Zone" throughout the analyzed quarters, with a peak of 8.837 in Q1 2025. This suggests that GameStop is not in immediate financial distress and has a strong likelihood of continued operational viability. However, the negative retained earnings signal a need for strategic repositioning to ensure long-term profitability.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational costs during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to improve liquidity and focus on core operations, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-term Repositioning**
   - **Strategic Innovation:** Invest in new product lines and digital transformation to adapt to changing market dynamics, as discussed by Beard (2024).
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster relationships with stakeholders to ensure alignment and support for strategic initiatives, following Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory.
