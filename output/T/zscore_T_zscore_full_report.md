## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

The purpose of this financial health analysis is to evaluate AT&T's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, using the Altman Z-Score framework to assess its risk status.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: 0.704 (below the ideal threshold of 1, indicating potential liquidity issues)
- **Quick Ratio**: 0.444 (suggests reliance on inventory for liquidity)

### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: 59.9% (indicates strong cost control)
- **Net Margin**: 9.64% (declining trend, reflecting pressure on profitability)
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: 4.17% (below industry average)
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: 10.88% (acceptable but could be improved)

### Capital Efficiency
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 119.25 (high leverage, indicating potential risk)
- **Total Debt**: $145.29 billion (significant burden on cash flow)

### Z-Score Analysis
The Z-Score components indicate a moderate risk of distress:
- **X1 (Working Capital/Total Assets)**: Negative working capital suggests liquidity challenges.
- **X2 (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)**: Negative retained earnings indicate historical losses.
- **X3 (EBIT/Total Assets)**: Positive but declining EBIT reflects operational challenges.
- **X4 (Market Value Equity/Total Liabilities)**: High debt levels compared to market capitalization.
- **X5 (Sales/Total Assets)**: Revenue growth is positive but not sufficient to offset debt concerns.

Overall, AT&T's Z-Score trajectory suggests a need for cautious management of debt and operational efficiency.
