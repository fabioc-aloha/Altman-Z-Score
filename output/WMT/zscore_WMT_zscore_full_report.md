## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Walmart's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, has shown a negative trend over the last few quarters, indicating potential liquidity challenges. A negative X1 suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets, which could lead to difficulties in meeting short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) reflects Walmart's ability to generate profits over time. With a value around 0.377, Walmart maintains a reasonable level of retained earnings, indicating a solid historical profitability that supports its financial stability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets) is relatively low, hovering around 0.025 to 0.031, which suggests that Walmart's operational efficiency in generating earnings from its assets may be under pressure. This could be a result of increased competition or rising operational costs.

### Leverage
Walmart's leverage, as indicated by the X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities), is strong at approximately 4.79. This high ratio indicates that Walmart is primarily financed through equity rather than debt, which is a positive sign for financial stability.

### Overall Z-Score Trend
The Z-Score has fluctuated between the safe and grey zones, with a current score of 4.112, indicating that Walmart is in a safe zone. However, the declining trend in liquidity and capital efficiency components raises concerns about future performance. The company must address these issues to maintain its financial health.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Strategy
1. **Immediate Retrenchment:**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This could involve renegotiating supplier contracts, reducing overhead costs, and optimizing inventory management.
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Focus on enhancing operational efficiency through process improvements and technology investments. This aligns with Hoskisson et al. (2004), who emphasize the importance of restructuring for improved performance.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new growth opportunities, particularly in e-commerce and digital services. This aligns with Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, which advocate for strategic repositioning in response to market changes.
   - **Innovation and Agility:** Foster a culture of innovation and agility within the organization, as suggested by Beard (2024), to adapt to changing consumer preferences and technological advancements.
