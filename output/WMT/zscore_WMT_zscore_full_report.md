## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Walmart's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a negative trend over the last few quarters. This suggests that the company may face challenges in meeting its short-term obligations, which could impact operational flexibility.

### Profitability
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) reflects Walmart's ability to generate profits over time. The steady increase in retained earnings indicates a positive profitability trend, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets) shows a modest but stable performance, indicating that Walmart is effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings before interest and taxes. This is essential for maintaining operational efficiency.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities) indicates a strong leverage position, with a ratio significantly above 1. This suggests that Walmart is less reliant on debt financing, which is a positive indicator of financial stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend shows that Walmart has consistently remained in the Safe Zone, with the latest score of 4.112 in Q1 2025. This indicates a low risk of bankruptcy and suggests that the company is financially healthy. However, the declining liquidity ratio raises concerns that should be addressed to maintain this status.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on the findings, immediate actions should focus on improving liquidity. This can be achieved through cost-cutting measures, optimizing inventory management, and renegotiating supplier terms to enhance cash flow. According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment is critical in stabilizing the financial position of a company facing liquidity issues.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Walmart should consider strategic repositioning. This includes investing in technology to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience, as suggested by Beard (2024). Additionally, diversifying product offerings and exploring new markets can help mitigate risks associated with market saturation.
