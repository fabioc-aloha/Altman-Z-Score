### Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

1. **Liquidity**: The X1 ratio indicates a slight improvement in liquidity but remains low, suggesting that current assets are only marginally exceeding current liabilities. This raises concerns about the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

2. **Profitability**: The X3 ratio shows low EBIT relative to total assets, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient operating income from its asset base. This is a critical area for improvement.

3. **Capital Efficiency**: The X2 ratio reflects a moderate level of retained earnings, suggesting that the company has retained some profits over time, but this is not sufficient to indicate strong financial health.

4. **Leverage**: The X4 ratio indicates a concerning level of debt relative to equity, which could pose risks in times of financial distress. The company is highly leveraged, which can limit financial flexibility.

5. **Z-Score Trend**: The Z-Score has consistently remained in the distress zone (below 1.81) over the last four quarters, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy. The slight upward trend in the Z-Score suggests that while the situation is improving, it is still critical to implement turnaround strategies.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**:
   - **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to stabilize cash flow. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation**: Identify non-core assets for sale to improve liquidity, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-Term Repositioning**:
   - **Strategic Focus**: Shift towards core competencies and high-margin products/services, following Hoskisson et al. (2004) on strategic restructuring.
   - **Innovation and R&D**: Invest in innovation to drive growth, as highlighted by Beard (2024), ensuring the company remains competitive in the technology sector.
