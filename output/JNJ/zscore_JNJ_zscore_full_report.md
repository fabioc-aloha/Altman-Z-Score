## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Johnson & Johnson's liquidity position appears stable, with a current ratio that indicates sufficient short-term assets to cover liabilities. However, the X1 component of the Z-Score shows a slight decline, suggesting a need for improved cash management strategies.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, particularly EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes), have shown fluctuations, with recent quarters reflecting challenges in maintaining consistent earnings. The X3 component indicates that profitability relative to total assets is currently low, which could be a concern for future growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The company has maintained a strong equity position relative to its liabilities, as indicated by the X4 component of the Z-Score. This suggests that JNJ is effectively managing its capital structure, which is a positive sign for long-term sustainability.

### Leverage
Leverage ratios indicate that JNJ is not over-leveraged, but the reliance on debt could be a risk factor if market conditions change. The X2 component shows that retained earnings are minimal, which may limit the company's ability to reinvest in growth initiatives.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Johnson & Johnson has fluctuated around the Grey Zone threshold, with the latest score at 2.119. This indicates that while the company is not in immediate distress, it is at risk of entering the Distress Zone if current trends continue. The trajectory suggests a need for strategic adjustments to enhance financial stability.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Johnson & Johnson's current position in the Grey Zone, the company should adopt a balanced approach that emphasizes both cost containment and strategic investments. 

- **Cost Containment:** Implement measures to reduce operational costs without sacrificing quality. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on addressing inefficiencies during recovery stages.
- **Strategic Investments:** Focus on core differentiators such as innovative product development and market expansion, as suggested by Hofer (1980) for turnaround sequencing. This will help JNJ leverage its strengths in R&D and maintain competitive advantage.
