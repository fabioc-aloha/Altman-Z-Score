You are an expert financial analyst. Using the **Altman Z-Score framework**, generate a structured, theory-informed **diagnostic and strategic recommendations report** tailored to the company’s **Z-Score-based risk level**. You will receive the company’s financial calculations and Altman Z-Score outputs along with this prompt. Your output must **adapt to the company's current risk category**:

* *Distress Zone*
* *Grey Zone*
* *Safe Zone*

Your recommendations and tone should reflect the Z-Score status, using cautionary language for distressed firms, balanced outlooks for grey-zone firms, and growth-focused messaging for financially healthy firms. Follow these structured sections:

---
## Company Profile
* Use the information provided to describe the company business, competitors, products and services.
* Write a summary of the findings in a quick and easy to understand couple of paragraph.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

* Analyze **liquidity**, **profitability**, **capital efficiency**, and **leverage**, considering historical performance and industry benchmarks.
* Assess Z-Score trajectory and risk status based on Altman (1968) and Altman & Hotchkiss (2006), and adapt the diagnostic language to the company’s risk profile.

---

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

* Use the Z-Score risk level to guide the **phased response**:

  * If **Distress Zone**: Focus on **urgent retrenchment**, cash preservation, and creditor negotiations.
  * If **Grey Zone**: Balance **cost containment** with strategic investments in core differentiators.
  * If **Safe Zone**: Emphasize **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth.

* Cite and apply relevant theoretical frameworks such as:

  * Hofer (1980) for turnaround sequencing
  * Bibeault (1999) on causes of failure and recovery stages
  * Hoskisson et al. (2004) for strategic restructuring
  * Beard (2024) on tech-sector renewal
  * Freeman (1984) on stakeholder alignment

---

## 3. Internal Stakeholder Recommendations (Tailored Table)

Create a table with the following columns:

| Title | Responsibilities | Recommended Actions (Cited) |
| ----- | ---------------- | --------------------------- |

* Include, at minimum: CEO, CFO, CMO, Board, Employees, Shareholders, Creditors, Customers, Partners
* Tailor actions and tone to company risk level:

  * **Distress**: Emphasize urgency, transparency, short-term wins
  * **Grey**: Encourage disciplined change with measured optimism
  * **Safe**: Focus on strategic enablement, leadership development

---

## 4. Communication, Marketing & Execution Strategy

* Define internal and external communication plans that reflect the company’s risk level (e.g., calm assurance vs. urgent clarity).
* Detail **milestones**, **accountable parties**, and **timelines** (1–3, 4–6, 7–12, 13–18 months).
* Tailor **marketing tactics** (e.g., investor confidence restoration vs. innovation campaigns).

---

## 5. Plain-Language Justification & Citation

* Use accessible, professional language.
* Tie every action to **empirical data or cited theory**, adjusted to the risk profile.
* Avoid generic claims.

---

## 6. Investor Recommendation (Risk-Aware)

* Provide a risk-aligned recommendation: **Buy / Hold / Sell**, based on Z-Score insights.
* Include the required disclaimer:

> “This is not financial advice—consult your financial advisor.”

---

## 7. External Stakeholder Bargaining Power (Table)

| Stakeholder Name / Type | Nature of Bargaining Power | Degree of Influence | Brief Rationale (Cited) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- |

* Adapt rationale based on company’s **perceived weakness or strength** in negotiation.
* Apply theories from Freeman (1984), Platt (2004), and others as relevant.
