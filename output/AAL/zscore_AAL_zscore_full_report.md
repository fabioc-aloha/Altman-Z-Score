# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL)

## Company Profile

American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL) is a major player in the air transportation industry, primarily operating in scheduled air transportation. The company is headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, and is recognized as one of the largest airlines in the world. AAL operates a vast network of domestic and international flights, competing with other major airlines such as Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and Southwest Airlines. The company offers a range of products and services, including passenger flights, cargo services, and various loyalty programs aimed at enhancing customer retention.

In recent years, American Airlines has faced significant challenges, particularly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the travel industry. The airline has had to navigate fluctuating demand, operational disruptions, and increased competition, which have all contributed to its current financial status. 

---

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
American Airlines has consistently struggled with liquidity, as evidenced by its negative working capital ratios (X1). The company’s current liabilities exceed its current assets, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. This is a critical concern, especially in the context of an industry that can be heavily impacted by external shocks.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics (X3) show that American Airlines has been operating at a loss, which is alarming for a company of its size. The EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) as a percentage of total assets remains negative, suggesting that the company is not generating sufficient operational income to cover its costs.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings (X2) are also negative, reflecting the cumulative losses over the years. This indicates that the company has not been able to reinvest profits back into the business, further exacerbating its financial difficulties.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4) indicates that while the company has some equity cushion, it is still heavily reliant on debt financing. The equity to total liabilities ratio is low, which raises concerns about the company’s ability to withstand financial distress.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
Based on the Altman Z-Score calculations, American Airlines is firmly in the **Distress Zone**, with a Z-Score of -1.606. This indicates a high probability of bankruptcy in the near term, necessitating immediate action to stabilize the company’s financial position.

---

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given the **Distress Zone** classification, the following phased response is recommended:

- **Urgent Retrenchment**: The company must prioritize cash preservation strategies. This includes reducing operational costs, renegotiating contracts with suppliers, and potentially deferring capital expenditures.
  
- **Creditor Negotiations**: Engaging with creditors to restructure debt obligations will be crucial. This may involve seeking extensions on payment terms or negotiating lower interest rates.

- **Operational Efficiency**: Implementing measures to improve operational efficiency, such as optimizing flight schedules and reducing workforce costs, will be essential to regain profitability.

The theoretical frameworks that support this approach include:

- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the importance of a structured turnaround strategy, focusing on immediate financial stabilization.
- **Bibeault (1999)**: Highlights the need for addressing the root causes of failure, which in this case includes high debt levels and operational inefficiencies.
- **Hoskisson et al. (2004)**: Suggests strategic restructuring as a pathway to recovery, which is critical for American Airlines at this juncture.

## 5. Plain-Language Justification & Citation
