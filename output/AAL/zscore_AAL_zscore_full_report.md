## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
American Airlines has been struggling with liquidity, as indicated by a negative X1 value across multiple quarters. This suggests that current liabilities exceed current assets, raising concerns about the company's ability to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) shows negative EBIT values, indicating that the company has been operating at a loss. This is a significant concern, especially in a capital-intensive industry like air transportation.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2) is also negative, reflecting accumulated losses over time. This is detrimental to the company's equity base and overall financial health.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4) indicates that equity is insufficient to cover liabilities, which is a red flag for creditors and investors alike.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the Distress Zone, with values ranging from -1.102 to -1.606 over the last five quarters. This trajectory indicates a high risk of bankruptcy and necessitates immediate action to stabilize the company.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given that American Airlines is firmly in the **Distress Zone**, the focus must be on urgent retrenchment, cash preservation, and creditor negotiations. 

### Phased Response
- **Immediate Actions**: Implement cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions and renegotiation of supplier contracts.
- **Cash Preservation**: Prioritize cash flow management by deferring non-essential capital expenditures and optimizing working capital.
- **Creditor Negotiations**: Engage with creditors to restructure debt obligations and seek temporary relief from financial covenants.

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the importance of a structured turnaround strategy, which American Airlines must adopt to stabilize operations.
- **Bibeault (1999)**: Highlights the need for a clear understanding of the causes of failure, which in this case include high operational costs and reduced demand.
- **Hoskisson et al. (2004)**: Suggests strategic restructuring, which may involve divesting non-core assets to focus on profitable routes and services.
