## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
American Airlines Group, Inc. (AAL) exhibits significant liquidity challenges, as indicated by the negative values for X1 (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets. This suggests that the company is unable to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets, which is a critical concern for operational stability.

### Profitability
The profitability metric (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) shows a marginally positive value in the most recent quarter, indicating that while AAL is generating some earnings before interest and taxes relative to its total assets, it remains insufficient to offset the overall financial distress indicated by the other components.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2: Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is negative, reflecting a history of losses that have eroded the equity base. This is a significant red flag, as it indicates that the company has not been able to reinvest profits into growth or stability.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4: Equity / Total Liabilities) is low, suggesting that AAL is heavily reliant on debt financing. This high leverage increases financial risk, especially in a volatile industry like airlines, where external shocks (e.g., fuel prices, economic downturns) can severely impact operations.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend for AAL has consistently remained in the distress zone (Z-Score < 1.23) over the past five quarters, indicating a high probability of bankruptcy. The downward trend in the Z-Score from -1.102 in Q2 2024 to -1.606 in Q1 2025 highlights the deteriorating financial condition of the company.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980) and Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment strategies should focus on cost-cutting measures, divesting non-core assets, and improving cash flow. AAL should prioritize:

- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing strict cost controls, renegotiating contracts with suppliers, and reducing workforce costs where feasible.
- **Asset Divestiture:** Selling non-essential assets or routes to improve liquidity and focus on core operations.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, Hoskisson et al. (2004) suggest a strategic renewal approach that involves redefining the business model and enhancing competitive advantage. AAL should consider:

- **Innovation in Services:** Investing in technology to improve customer experience and operational efficiency.
- **Market Expansion:** Exploring new markets or partnerships to diversify revenue streams.
