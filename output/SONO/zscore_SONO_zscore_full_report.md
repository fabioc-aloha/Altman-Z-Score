## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Sonos has demonstrated a moderate liquidity position, with a current ratio (X1) of 0.206 in Q1 2025, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. This is a decline from previous quarters, suggesting a need for improved cash management strategies.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, particularly the retained earnings (X2), show a negative value of -0.089 in Q1 2025, reflecting ongoing challenges in generating sustainable profits. This trend is concerning and indicates that the company may need to reassess its pricing strategies and cost structures.

### Capital Efficiency
Capital efficiency, as measured by EBIT (X3), is also negative at -0.075, indicating that Sonos is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings. This could be a signal for the company to optimize its operational processes and enhance productivity.

### Leverage
Sonos maintains a strong equity position relative to its liabilities (X4 = 3.13), which is a positive indicator of financial stability. This suggests that the company has a solid capital structure, providing a buffer against potential downturns.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Sonos is 2.082, placing it in the **Grey Zone**. This indicates that while the company is not in immediate financial distress, it is at risk of entering the distress zone if current trends continue. The trajectory shows fluctuations between the Grey and Safe Zones, highlighting the need for strategic interventions to stabilize and improve financial health.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Sonos's current position in the Grey Zone, the following phased response is recommended:

1. **Cost Containment**: Implement strict cost control measures to improve profitability. This includes reviewing operational expenses and identifying areas for reduction without compromising product quality.
   
2. **Strategic Investments**: Allocate resources towards core differentiators such as product innovation and marketing efforts that emphasize the unique features of Sonos products. This aligns with Hoskisson et al. (2004) on strategic restructuring.

3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Foster strong relationships with stakeholders, including customers and investors, to enhance brand loyalty and investor confidence. Freeman (1984) emphasizes the importance of stakeholder alignment in achieving long-term success.

4. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to regularly assess financial health and operational efficiency, ensuring timely adjustments to strategies as needed.
