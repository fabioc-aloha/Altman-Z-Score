## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Sonos, Inc. is reflected in the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the working capital relative to total assets. As of Q1 2025, the X1 value is 0.206, indicating that the company has a moderate liquidity position. This is a decline from 0.302 in Q1 2024, suggesting a potential tightening of liquidity. The current ratio, derived from current assets and current liabilities, also supports this observation, as current liabilities have increased relative to current assets.

### Profitability
Profitability is assessed through the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets). The negative EBIT of -59.1 million in Q1 2025 leads to an X3 value of -0.075, a significant decline from the positive 0.046 in Q4 2024. This trend indicates that Sonos is struggling to generate profits, which is a critical concern for stakeholders.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) shows a negative value of -0.089 in Q1 2025, down from -0.001 in Q4 2024. This indicates that the company has accumulated losses, which negatively impacts its capital efficiency and overall financial health.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities) is relatively strong at 3.13 in Q1 2025, although it has decreased from 5.303 in Q1 2024. This suggests that while Sonos has a reasonable market capitalization relative to its debt, the declining trend indicates increasing leverage risk.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for Sonos, Inc. has fluctuated between the "Safe Zone" and "Grey Zone." The current Z-Score of 2.082 places the company in the Grey Zone, indicating a heightened risk of financial distress. This trend is concerning, as it suggests that without intervention, the company may face increasing challenges in maintaining its financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment is essential for companies facing financial distress. Sonos should focus on cost-cutting measures, including reducing operational expenses, renegotiating supplier contracts, and potentially downsizing staff. This aligns with Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, which emphasize the need for immediate action to stabilize the financial situation.

### Long-Term Repositioning
Long-term repositioning involves strategic changes to ensure sustainable growth. Hoskisson et al. (2004) suggest that companies should reassess their market positioning and product offerings. Sonos should consider diversifying its product line and exploring new markets to enhance revenue streams. Additionally, investing in innovation and technology can help the company regain competitive advantage.
