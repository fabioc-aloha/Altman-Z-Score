## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Sonos has shown moderate liquidity, with a current ratio hovering around 0.206 in the latest quarter. This indicates potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations, especially when compared to industry benchmarks.

### Profitability
The company has faced profitability issues, as evidenced by a negative retained earnings figure in the latest quarter (-0.089). This trend raises concerns about long-term sustainability and the ability to reinvest in growth.

### Capital Efficiency
Sonos's capital efficiency is reflected in its EBIT to total assets ratio, which is negative (-0.075) in the most recent quarter. This suggests that the company is not generating sufficient operating income relative to its asset base.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio, represented by equity to total liabilities, is relatively strong at 3.13, indicating that Sonos has a solid capital structure. However, the high leverage may also pose risks if profitability does not improve.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Sonos is currently at 2.082, placing it in the **Grey Zone**. This indicates that while the company is not in immediate distress, it faces significant financial challenges that require careful management. The trajectory shows fluctuations between the Grey and Safe Zones, suggesting volatility in financial performance.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Sonos's current **Grey Zone** status, the company should focus on balancing cost containment with strategic investments in core differentiators. 

- **Phased Response**:
  - **Cost Containment**: Implement measures to reduce operational costs without sacrificing product quality.
  - **Strategic Investments**: Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage.

Relevant theoretical frameworks include:
- **Hofer (1980)** for turnaround sequencing, emphasizing the need for immediate cost control followed by strategic investments.
- **Bibeault (1999)** highlights the importance of addressing causes of failure, which in Sonos's case includes profitability and liquidity issues.
- **Freeman (1984)** on stakeholder alignment, ensuring that all stakeholders are engaged in the turnaround process.
