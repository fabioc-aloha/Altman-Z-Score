## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Sonos has shown a moderate liquidity position, with a current ratio of approximately 0.206 in Q1 2025, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. This is a decline from previous quarters, where the current ratio was higher, suggesting a need for improved cash management strategies.

### Profitability
The company has faced profitability challenges, as indicated by a negative retained earnings figure (-0.089 in Q1 2025). This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of its operations and the ability to generate consistent profits.

### Capital Efficiency
Sonos's capital efficiency, measured by EBIT to total assets, has been negative (-0.075 in Q1 2025), indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings. This is a critical area for improvement.

### Leverage
The company's leverage position appears relatively strong, with an equity to total liabilities ratio of 3.13 in Q1 2025. This suggests that Sonos is not overly reliant on debt, which is a positive indicator for financial stability.

### Z-Score Trajectory

- **Strategic Investments**: Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage. This aligns with Beard's (2024) emphasis on tech-sector renewal.

### Theoretical Frameworks:
- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the importance of sequencing turnaround strategies, suggesting that Sonos should prioritize immediate cost reductions followed by strategic investments.
- **Freeman (1984)**: Highlights the need for stakeholder alignment, which is crucial for gaining support for any strategic initiatives.
