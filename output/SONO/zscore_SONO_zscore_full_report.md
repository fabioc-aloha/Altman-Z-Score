## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity ratio (X1) shows a declining trend, moving from 0.302 in Q1 2024 to 0.206 in Q1 2025. This indicates a decrease in the company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its current assets, which is a concerning sign for stakeholders.

### Profitability
The profitability measure (X3) has been negative in the last two quarters, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to its total assets. This trend raises concerns about the company's operational efficiency and profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2) is negative, suggesting that Sonos has accumulated losses rather than profits. This is a significant red flag, as it indicates that the company may have difficulty reinvesting in growth or paying dividends.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4) remains strong at 3.13, indicating that the company has a solid equity base relative to its liabilities. However, this strength is overshadowed by the declining liquidity and profitability metrics.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has fluctuated between the Grey Zone and Safe Zone, with a current score of 2.082, indicating that Sonos is at risk of financial distress. The downward trend in liquidity and profitability suggests that immediate action is necessary to stabilize the company's financial health.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational costs during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Consider selling non-core assets to generate cash. This is consistent with Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies focusing on asset management.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new growth opportunities. Hoskisson et al. (2004) highlight the importance of strategic realignment in corporate restructuring.
   - **Innovation Focus:** Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and differentiate from competitors. Beard (2024) discusses the necessity of innovation in technology firms for sustainable growth.
