## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Sonos has demonstrated a moderate liquidity position, with a current ratio hovering around 0.206 in Q1 2025, indicating potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations. This is below the industry benchmark, suggesting a need for improved cash management strategies.

### Profitability
The company has faced profitability challenges, as indicated by a negative retained earnings figure (-0.089 in Q1 2025). This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of its operations and the ability to generate consistent profits.

### Capital Efficiency
Sonos shows a capital efficiency ratio (EBIT/Total Assets) of -0.075, indicating that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings. This is a critical area for improvement, especially in a competitive market.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (Equity/Total Liabilities) is relatively strong at 3.13, suggesting that Sonos has a solid equity base compared to its liabilities. However, the high leverage could also indicate potential risks if the company faces downturns in revenue.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score for Sonos has fluctuated between the Grey Zone and Safe Zone, with a score of 2.082 in Q1 2025, placing it in the Grey Zone. This indicates a moderate risk of bankruptcy, necessitating strategic interventions to enhance financial stability.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Sonos's current status in the Grey Zone, the company should adopt a balanced approach focusing on cost containment while strategically investing in core differentiators. 

### Phased Response
- **Cost Containment:** Implement strict budget controls and reduce discretionary spending to preserve cash.
- **Strategic Investments:** Focus on enhancing product innovation and marketing efforts to differentiate from competitors.

Relevant frameworks include:
- **Hofer (1980)** emphasizes the importance of sequencing turnaround strategies, suggesting that Sonos should prioritize immediate financial stabilization before pursuing growth initiatives.
- **Bibeault (1999)** highlights the need for a clear understanding of the causes of financial distress, which in Sonos's case, may stem from market competition and operational inefficiencies.
