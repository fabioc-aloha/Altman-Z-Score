# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Sonos, Inc. (SONO)

## Company Profile

Sonos, Inc. is a prominent player in the consumer electronics industry, specializing in the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of audio products and services. The company offers a diverse range of products, including wireless, portable, and home theater speakers, as well as headphones, components, and accessories. Sonos markets its products through various channels, including physical stores, online retailers, and custom installers, catering to a global audience across the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

Despite its innovative product offerings, Sonos has faced challenges reflected in its recent financial performance. The company has experienced a significant decline in stock value, with a 52-week change of approximately -34.94%, contrasting sharply with the S&P 500's positive growth of 11.89% over the same period. This discrepancy highlights the competitive pressures Sonos faces within the consumer electronics sector, where it competes with established brands and emerging technologies.

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Sonos has a current ratio of 1.564, indicating that it has sufficient short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities. However, the quick ratio of 0.911 suggests potential liquidity concerns, as it indicates that the company may struggle to meet its obligations without relying on inventory sales.

### Profitability
The company is currently facing profitability challenges, as evidenced by a negative net income of approximately -$69.29 million and a profit margin of -4.74%. The operating margin is also negative at -14.45%, indicating that operational costs are exceeding revenues.

### Capital Efficiency
Sonos's return on assets (ROA) is -2.55%, and return on equity (ROE) is -15.80%, both of which are below industry benchmarks. This suggests inefficiencies in utilizing assets and equity to generate profits.

### Leverage
Sonos has a debt-to-equity ratio of 16.462, indicating a high level of leverage. While this can amplify returns during profitable periods, it also increases financial risk, particularly in a downturn.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The most recent Z-Score for Sonos is 2.082, placing it in the **Grey Zone**. This indicates that while the company is not in immediate distress, it is at risk of entering the distress zone if corrective actions are not taken. The Z-Score has shown fluctuations, moving from the Safe Zone in Q4 2024 to the Grey Zone in Q1 2025, reflecting a concerning downward trend.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Sonos's current position in the Grey Zone, a balanced approach is necessary. 

- **Cost Containment**: Implement strict cost management practices to improve profitability. This includes reviewing operational expenses and identifying areas for reduction without compromising product quality.
  
- **Strategic Investments**: Focus on investing in core differentiators such as product innovation and customer experience enhancements. This aligns with Beard's (2024) emphasis on tech-sector renewal, which highlights the importance of innovation in maintaining competitive advantage.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Foster strong relationships with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors, to build trust and support for the company's strategic initiatives (Freeman, 1984).
