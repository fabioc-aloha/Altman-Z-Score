## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |     X2 |     X3 |    X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic   |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|-------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025 Q1   | 0.206 | -0.089 | -0.075 | 3.13  | 0.328 |     2.082 | Grey Zone    |
| 2024 Q4   | 0.249 | -0.001 |  0.046 | 3.653 | 0.572 |     3.212 | Safe Zone    |
| 2024 Q3   | 0.202 | -0.056 | -0.068 | 3.026 | 0.279 |     2.035 | Grey Zone    |
| 2024 Q2   | 0.247 |  0.002 |  0.013 | 3.568 | 0.413 |     2.898 | Grey Zone    |

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Sonos, Inc. is reflected in the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the working capital relative to total assets. The current X1 value of 0.206 indicates that the company has a moderate liquidity position, but it is below the optimal threshold. This suggests that Sonos may face challenges in meeting short-term obligations, especially as it has fluctuated between the Grey Zone and Safe Zone in recent quarters.

### Profitability
The profitability of Sonos is assessed through the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets). The current value of -0.075 indicates that the company is not generating sufficient earnings before interest and taxes relative to its asset base. This is a concerning trend, as profitability is crucial for sustaining operations and funding growth initiatives.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) shows a negative value of -0.089, indicating that Sonos has not retained earnings effectively, which can hinder its ability to reinvest in the business. This is a critical area for improvement, as it reflects the company's historical performance and its ability to generate profits over time.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) at 3.13 indicates a strong leverage position, suggesting that Sonos has a solid equity base relative to its liabilities. This is a positive sign, as it implies that the company is less reliant on debt financing, which can be beneficial in times of financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score trend for Sonos indicates a concerning shift. The company has moved from the Safe Zone (Z-Score of 3.212 in Q4 2024) to the Grey Zone (Z-Score of 2.082 in Q1 2025). This downward trend suggests increasing financial distress and warrants immediate attention to address the underlying issues affecting profitability and liquidity.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Reduction:** Implement immediate cost-cutting measures to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational expenses during a turnaround.
   - **Asset Liquidation:** Identify non-core assets for divestiture to generate cash flow, as suggested by Hoskisson et al. (2004).
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline operations to enhance productivity and reduce waste, following Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Sustainable Growth)**
   - **Market Reassessment:** Conduct a thorough market analysis to identify new growth opportunities and reposition the brand accordingly, as discussed by Beard (2024).
   - **Innovation Focus:** Invest in R&D to develop new products that meet changing consumer preferences, leveraging Altman and Hotchkiss's (2006) insights on innovation as a recovery strategy.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster stronger relationships with stakeholders to enhance support for strategic initiatives, following Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory.
