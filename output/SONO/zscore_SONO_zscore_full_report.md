## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Overview
The Altman Z-Score is a key indicator of a company's financial health, particularly its likelihood of bankruptcy. For Sonos, Inc. (SONO), the Z-Score trend over recent quarters shows fluctuations between the "Safe Zone" and "Grey Zone," indicating varying levels of financial stability.

### Key Financial Metrics
1. **Liquidity (X1)**: The liquidity ratio has shown a slight decline from 0.302 in Q1 2024 to 0.206 in Q1 2025. This indicates a decrease in the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.
  
2. **Profitability (X2)**: Retained earnings have remained negative, with a slight improvement from -0.089 in Q1 2025 to -0.001 in Q4 2024. This suggests ongoing challenges in generating profits.

3. **Capital Efficiency (X3)**: EBIT has been negative across the quarters, reflecting operational inefficiencies. The most recent quarter shows an EBIT of -59.1 million USD.

4. **Leverage (X4)**: The market value of equity relative to total liabilities has remained strong, indicating that the company is not overly leveraged. The ratio improved from 5.303 in Q1 2024 to 3.13 in Q1 2025.

5. **Sales Efficiency (X5)**: Sales relative to total assets have decreased, indicating a decline in the efficiency of asset utilization to generate revenue.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
- **Q1 2025**: Z-Score of 2.082 (Grey Zone) indicates potential financial distress.
- **Q4 2024**: Z-Score of 3.212 (Safe Zone) suggests a healthier financial position.
- **Overall Trend**: The company has moved from a safe financial position to a grey zone, indicating a need for immediate action to stabilize operations.
