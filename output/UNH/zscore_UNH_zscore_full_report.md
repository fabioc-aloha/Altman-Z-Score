## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH) is indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the difference between current assets and current liabilities relative to total assets. The negative values of X1 across the quarters suggest that UNH has been facing challenges in meeting its short-term obligations, which could be a concern for stakeholders.

### Profitability
The X3 component, representing EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) relative to total assets, indicates a stable profitability trend, albeit at a low level. This suggests that while UNH is generating some earnings, the efficiency of asset utilization could be improved.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component, which measures retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, shows a consistent level of retained earnings, indicating that UNH has been able to reinvest profits back into the business. This is a positive sign for long-term sustainability.

### Leverage
The X4 component, which assesses equity relative to total liabilities, remains strong, indicating that UNH has a solid capital structure with a good buffer against financial distress. This is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and creditworthiness.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the safe zone (above 2.90) over the analyzed quarters, indicating that UNH is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy. However, the declining trend in X1 and X3 components suggests potential liquidity and profitability issues that need to be addressed to maintain this status.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, a two-phased response is recommended:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment:**
   - Focus on improving liquidity by optimizing working capital management. This includes reducing inventory levels and accelerating accounts receivable collections.
   - Implement cost-cutting measures to enhance profitability, such as reviewing operational efficiencies and renegotiating supplier contracts.

2. **Long-Term Repositioning:**
   - Invest in technology and innovation to improve service delivery and customer engagement, aligning with Beard's (2024) emphasis on strategic renewal in technology firms.
   - Explore new market opportunities and diversify service offerings to enhance revenue streams, as suggested by Hoskisson et al. (2004).
