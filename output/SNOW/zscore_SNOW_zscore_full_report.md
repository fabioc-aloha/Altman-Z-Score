## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Snowflake's liquidity position is robust, with a current ratio consistently above 1.0, indicating that the company can comfortably meet its short-term obligations. The X1 component of the Z-Score reflects a healthy balance between current assets and current liabilities, suggesting effective cash management practices.

### Profitability
Despite operating in a competitive environment, Snowflake has shown resilience in profitability metrics. The X3 component indicates that the company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) are positive, contributing positively to the overall Z-Score. However, the negative retained earnings (X2) highlight the need for sustained profitability to improve shareholder equity.

### Capital Efficiency
Snowflake's capital efficiency is demonstrated through its ability to generate revenue relative to its total assets. The company has effectively utilized its assets to drive growth, as evidenced by the increasing Z-Score over the past quarters.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio, represented by the X4 component, indicates that Snowflake maintains a strong equity position relative to its liabilities. This is a positive sign for investors, as it suggests lower financial risk and greater stability.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Snowflake Inc. has consistently remained in the **Safe Zone**, with the latest score at **9.539**. This indicates a strong financial position with low bankruptcy risk, aligning with Altman’s (1968) and Altman & Hotchkiss’s (2006) findings that a Z-Score above 2.90 signifies financial health.
