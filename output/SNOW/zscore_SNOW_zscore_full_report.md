## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Snowflake's liquidity position appears robust, with a current ratio indicating that current assets significantly exceed current liabilities. This suggests that the company is well-positioned to meet its short-term obligations.

### Profitability
Despite the strong liquidity, profitability metrics indicate challenges, as evidenced by negative retained earnings. This could be a concern for long-term sustainability, as consistent profitability is essential for growth and investor confidence.

### Capital Efficiency
Snowflake demonstrates strong capital efficiency, with a high equity-to-total liabilities ratio. This indicates that the company is primarily financed through equity, reducing reliance on debt and enhancing financial stability.

### Leverage
The leverage ratios suggest a conservative approach to debt, which is favorable in the current economic climate. However, the negative EBIT indicates that the company is not generating sufficient earnings before interest and taxes, which could hinder future growth.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Snowflake is currently at 9.539, placing it firmly in the **Safe Zone** (Z > 2.90). This indicates a low risk of bankruptcy and suggests that the company is financially healthy. The Z-Score has shown consistent improvement over the past quarters, reflecting strong operational performance and effective financial management.
