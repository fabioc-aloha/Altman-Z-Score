## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

The purpose of this financial health analysis is to assess Snowflake's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, particularly in light of its current Z-Score status.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: 1.579
- **Quick Ratio**: 1.473

These ratios indicate that Snowflake has sufficient liquidity to cover its short-term obligations, which is a positive sign for operational stability.

### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: 66.58%
- **Net Margin**: -36.43%
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: -11.56%
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: -40.14%

While the gross margin is strong, the negative net margin and returns indicate ongoing challenges in converting revenue into profit, which is a critical area for improvement.

### Capital Efficiency
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 111.30%
- **Total Debt**: $2.68 billion

The high debt-to-equity ratio suggests that Snowflake is heavily leveraged, which could pose risks if revenue growth does not continue to outpace debt servicing costs.

### Z-Score Assessment
The Z-Score components indicate a moderate risk of financial distress, with the company needing to focus on improving profitability and managing debt levels. The trajectory shows some improvement, but the overall risk remains elevated.
