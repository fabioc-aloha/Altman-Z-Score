## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Snowflake Inc. demonstrates strong liquidity, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, which has consistently remained above 0.2 across the quarters analyzed. This suggests that the company is well-positioned to meet its short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets) reflects a negative trend, indicating that Snowflake is currently not generating positive operating income relative to its total assets. This could be a concern for stakeholders, as profitability is crucial for long-term sustainability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is negative, which indicates that the company has not retained earnings over time, possibly due to reinvestment strategies or operational losses. This situation may raise concerns about the company's ability to generate internal funds for growth.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities) shows a strong leverage position, with values significantly above 1, indicating that Snowflake has a solid equity base relative to its liabilities. This suggests a lower risk of financial distress from leverage.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone" (> 2.90) over the analyzed quarters, indicating that Snowflake is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy. However, the declining profitability and negative retained earnings signal potential long-term challenges that require strategic attention.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Bibeault (1999), immediate retrenchment strategies should focus on cost-cutting measures and improving cash flow. Snowflake should consider the following actions:
- **Cost Reduction:** Identify non-essential expenditures and streamline operations to improve profitability.
- **Focus on Core Competencies:** Concentrate on high-margin products and services to enhance revenue generation.

### Long-term Repositioning
As per Hofer (1980), long-term strategies should involve repositioning the company for sustainable growth. Snowflake should:
- **Invest in R&D:** Allocate resources to innovation and product development to enhance competitive advantage.
- **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets and customer segments to diversify revenue streams.
