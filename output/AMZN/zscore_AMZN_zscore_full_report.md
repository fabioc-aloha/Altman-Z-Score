## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |    X3 |    X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic   |

| 2024 Q3   | 0.024 | 0.261 | 0.032 | 6.078 | 0.272 |     4.419 | Safe Zone    |

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Amazon's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a steady increase from 0.021 in Q1 2024 to 0.013 in Q1 2025. This suggests that the company maintains a healthy liquidity buffer, allowing it to meet short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure, represented by the X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets), has remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 0.026 and 0.037 over the analyzed quarters. This indicates that Amazon is effectively generating earnings from its asset base, which is crucial for sustaining operations and funding growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) has shown a gradual decline from 0.234 in Q1 2024 to 0.295 in Q1 2025. While this may raise concerns about retained earnings growth, it is essential to consider that Amazon's reinvestment strategies often prioritize expansion over immediate profit retention.

### Leverage
Amazon's leverage, indicated by the X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities), has consistently remained above 5, peaking at 6.872 in Q4 2024. This high ratio suggests that Amazon is effectively managing its debt levels, which is a positive indicator of financial health.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 4.362 to 4.954 over the last five quarters. This trend indicates that Amazon is not at risk of bankruptcy and is financially stable, allowing for continued investment and growth opportunities.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the current financial health of Amazon, the following phased response is proposed:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Focus)**
   - **Cost Management:** Implement cost-cutting measures in non-essential areas to improve short-term profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during downturns.
   - **Cash Flow Monitoring:** Enhance cash flow management practices to ensure liquidity remains robust, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Focus)**
   - **Innovation and Diversification:** Invest in new technologies and market segments to drive growth, reflecting Hoskisson et al. (2004) principles of strategic renewal.
   - **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster relationships with key stakeholders to align interests and drive collaborative growth strategies, as advocated by Freeman (1984).
