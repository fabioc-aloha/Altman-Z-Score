## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Amazon's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a positive trend with values ranging from 0.013 to 0.027 over the last four quarters. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, although the low values indicate a tight liquidity position.

### Profitability
The X2 component, which reflects retained earnings as a proportion of total assets, has shown a slight decline from 0.295 in Q1 2025 to 0.234 in Q1 2024. This indicates a decrease in profitability, which could be a concern for long-term sustainability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component, representing EBIT as a percentage of total assets, remains relatively stable, indicating that Amazon is efficiently utilizing its assets to generate earnings. The values hover around 0.035, which is modest but consistent.

### Leverage
The X4 component shows a strong leverage position with values above 5.0, indicating that Amazon has a solid equity base compared to its liabilities. This suggests a low risk of financial distress from excessive debt.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
Amazon's Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a score of 4.377 in Q1 2025, reflecting strong financial health. The trend indicates that the company is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy, but the declining profitability (X2) warrants attention. The Z-Score trend suggests that while Amazon is financially stable, it may need to address profitability concerns to maintain its position.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on the declining profitability, immediate actions should focus on cost management and operational efficiency. Hofer (1980) emphasizes the importance of cost-cutting measures during downturns. Amazon should conduct a thorough review of its operational expenses and identify areas for reduction without compromising service quality.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Amazon should consider strategic renewal initiatives. Bibeault (1999) suggests that companies must innovate and adapt to changing market conditions. Amazon could invest in new technologies and diversify its product offerings to enhance profitability. Additionally, Hoskisson et al. (2004) highlight the importance of restructuring and strategic realignment to improve competitive positioning.
