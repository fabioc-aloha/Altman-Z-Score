# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Amazon's liquidity position is relatively stable, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the working capital relative to total assets. The X1 value has shown a slight decline from 0.027 in Q2 2024 to 0.013 in Q1 2025, suggesting a tightening of liquidity. However, the overall liquidity remains within a safe zone, indicating that the company can meet its short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability of Amazon is reflected in the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), which has remained consistent around 0.035 to 0.037 over the last two quarters. This stability indicates that Amazon is effectively generating earnings from its asset base, although the slight decline in EBIT from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 may warrant attention.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) has shown a gradual decrease from 0.277 in Q4 2024 to 0.295 in Q1 2025. This trend suggests that while Amazon is retaining earnings, the growth rate may be slowing compared to its asset growth, which could impact long-term capital efficiency.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities) has increased from 6.078 in Q3 2024 to 5.987 in Q1 2025, indicating a strong equity position relative to liabilities. This suggests that Amazon is less leveraged and has a solid capital structure, which is favorable for long-term sustainability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained above 4.0, indicating that Amazon is in the "Safe Zone" and is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy. The slight fluctuations in the Z-Score components suggest that while the company is performing well, it should remain vigilant regarding liquidity and profitability trends.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the diagnostic evaluation, a phased response is recommended:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Actions)**
   - **Cost Management:** Implement cost-cutting measures in non-essential areas to improve liquidity. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
   - **Inventory Management:** Optimize inventory levels to free up cash, reflecting Hoskisson et al.'s (2004) focus on operational efficiency.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Actions)**
   - **Market Expansion:** Explore new market segments and product lines to drive revenue growth, as suggested by Hofer's (1980) strategies for corporate renewal.
   - **Technology Investment:** Invest in technology to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience, aligning with Beard's (2024) insights on strategic renewal in technology firms.
