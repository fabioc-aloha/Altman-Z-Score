## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Amazon's liquidity position appears strong, with a current ratio that indicates sufficient short-term assets to cover liabilities. This is critical for maintaining operational flexibility.

### Profitability
The company has demonstrated robust profitability metrics, with consistent earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) contributing positively to its Z-Score. This reflects effective cost management and revenue generation strategies.

### Capital Efficiency
Amazon's capital efficiency is evident in its ability to generate sales relative to total assets, indicating effective utilization of resources. The sales-to-assets ratio remains favorable, supporting its growth trajectory.

### Leverage
With a high equity-to-liabilities ratio, Amazon exhibits low financial leverage, reducing the risk of insolvency. This strong capital structure is a positive indicator of financial health.

### Z-Score Trajectory

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Amazon's current status in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and **stakeholder alignment for sustained growth**. 

- **Innovation**: Invest in new technologies and services to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency.
- **Repositioning**: Explore new market segments and diversify product offerings to mitigate risks associated with market saturation.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engage with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and shareholders, to ensure alignment with corporate goals and values.

Theoretical frameworks such as **Freeman (1984)** on stakeholder alignment and **Hoskisson et al. (2004)** for strategic restructuring can guide these initiatives.
