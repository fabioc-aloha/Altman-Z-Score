# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Amazon's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a consistent positive trend, albeit at a low level (ranging from 0.013 to 0.027). This suggests that while Amazon has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities, the buffer is minimal. The current ratio, calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, supports this observation, indicating that Amazon is managing its short-term obligations but should aim to improve its liquidity position.

### Profitability
The profitability of Amazon, represented by the X2 component (retained earnings to total assets), has shown a slight decline from 0.295 in Q1 2025 to 0.234 in Q1 2024. This indicates that while Amazon is retaining earnings, the growth rate of retained earnings is not keeping pace with total asset growth, which could signal potential challenges in maintaining profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component (EBIT to total assets) reflects Amazon's ability to generate earnings from its assets. The values have remained relatively stable, ranging from 0.026 to 0.037, indicating that Amazon is effectively utilizing its assets to generate earnings, although there is room for improvement.

### Leverage
The X4 component (market value of equity to total liabilities) shows a strong position, with values consistently above 5.987. This indicates that Amazon has a solid equity base relative to its liabilities, suggesting a lower risk of financial distress. The X5 component (sales to total assets) also reflects efficient asset utilization, with values around 0.242 to 0.301, indicating strong sales performance relative to total assets.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 4.362 to 4.954. This indicates that Amazon is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy and is financially stable. However, the slight decline in profitability metrics warrants attention to ensure that the company maintains its strong financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, a phased response is recommended:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment (Short-term Focus)**
   - **Cost Management:** Implement cost-cutting measures to improve profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
   - **Liquidity Enhancement:** Increase cash reserves by optimizing inventory management and reducing non-essential expenditures.

2. **Long-term Repositioning (Strategic Focus)**
   - **Market Expansion:** Explore new markets and product lines to drive revenue growth, as suggested by Hofer (1980).
   - **Innovation Investment:** Invest in technology and innovation to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience, aligning with Beard's (2024) focus on strategic renewal in technology firms.
