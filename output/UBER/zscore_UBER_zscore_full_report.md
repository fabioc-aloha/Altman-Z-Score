## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

The purpose of this financial health analysis is to evaluate Uber's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, using the Altman Z-Score framework to assess its risk status.

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio**: 1.02 (indicating adequate short-term liquidity)
- **Quick Ratio**: 0.83 (suggesting potential liquidity concerns)

### Profitability
- **Gross Margin**: 33.59%
- **Net Margin**: 27.07%
- **Return on Assets (ROA)**: 5.21%
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: 69.38%

### Capital Efficiency
- **Debt to Equity Ratio**: 48.57 (high leverage)
- **Total Debt**: $11.12 billion

### Leverage
Uber's high debt levels relative to equity raise concerns about financial stability, particularly in a volatile market. However, the company has shown resilience in generating positive cash flows.

### Z-Score Analysis
The Z-Score components indicate a moderate risk profile:
- **X1 (Working Capital/Total Assets)**: 0.45
- **X2 (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)**: -0.36
- **X3 (EBIT/Total Assets)**: 0.03
- **X4 (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities)**: 0.73
- **X5 (Sales/Total Assets)**: 0.85

The overall Z-Score suggests that while Uber is not in immediate distress, it must navigate carefully to avoid slipping into a more precarious financial position.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Uber's current Grey Zone status, the company should focus on balancing cost containment with strategic investments in its core differentiators. This approach aligns with Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing, emphasizing the need for operational efficiency while pursuing growth opportunities.

Recent management changes and market shifts necessitate a focus on:
- **Cost Management**: Streamlining operations to improve margins.
- **Strategic Investments**: Enhancing technology and service offerings to maintain competitive advantage.

The application of Bibeault's (1999) recovery stages suggests that Uber should prioritize stabilizing its financial position while exploring avenues for growth, particularly in its Delivery and Freight segments.
