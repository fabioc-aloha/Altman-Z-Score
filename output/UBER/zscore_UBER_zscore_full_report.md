## Company Profile

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Financial Analysis

- **Liquidity:** Uber's current ratio, derived from the X1 component of the Z-Score, indicates a slight positive liquidity position, though it remains close to zero. This suggests that while the company can cover its short-term liabilities, it may not have a significant buffer.
  
- **Profitability:** The negative retained earnings (X2) indicate that Uber has accumulated losses over time, which is common in tech startups but raises concerns about long-term sustainability. The EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) to total assets ratio (X3) shows a modest profitability level, reflecting operational challenges in achieving consistent profitability.

- **Capital Efficiency:** The equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) is strong, indicating that Uber is primarily financed through equity rather than debt, which is a positive sign for long-term financial stability.

- **Leverage:** The overall leverage appears manageable, with a high equity ratio suggesting that the company is less reliant on debt financing.

### Z-Score Assessment

Uber's Z-Score trajectory has consistently remained in the **Safe Zone**, with the latest score at **4.397**. This indicates a low risk of bankruptcy and suggests that the company is financially healthy. However, the negative retained earnings signal a need for strategic focus on profitability to ensure long-term sustainability.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Uber's position in the **Safe Zone**, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and stakeholder alignment for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation:** Emphasize the development of new technologies and services, particularly in autonomous vehicles and delivery logistics, to maintain competitive advantage.
  
- **Repositioning:** Explore new market segments and partnerships that can enhance service offerings and customer engagement.

- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Foster strong relationships with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors, to ensure alignment on strategic goals.

Theoretical frameworks such as **Freeman (1984)** on stakeholder alignment and **Beard (2024)** on tech-sector renewal can guide these initiatives.
