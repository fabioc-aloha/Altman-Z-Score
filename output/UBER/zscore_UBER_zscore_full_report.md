## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Uber's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, shows a positive trend with values consistently above zero. This suggests that the company is managing its current assets effectively relative to its current liabilities, which is crucial for meeting short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The X2 component indicates negative retained earnings, reflecting challenges in profitability over the years. This is a critical area of concern, as it suggests that the company has not yet achieved sustained profitability, which is essential for long-term financial health.

### Capital Efficiency
The X3 component, representing EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) relative to total assets, shows a modest positive value, indicating that Uber is generating some operational income relative to its asset base. However, this is still an area for improvement, especially in comparison to industry benchmarks.

### Leverage
The X4 component indicates a strong equity position relative to total liabilities, suggesting that Uber is not overly leveraged. This is a positive sign, as it indicates financial stability and the ability to absorb potential losses without jeopardizing the company's solvency.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
Uber's Z-Score has consistently remained in the Safe Zone, with the latest score at 4.397. This indicates a low risk of bankruptcy and suggests that the company is in a strong financial position relative to its peers. The trajectory shows stability and potential for growth, which is encouraging for stakeholders.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Uber's position in the Safe Zone, the focus should be on **innovation, repositioning**, and **stakeholder alignment** for sustained growth. 

- **Innovation**: Invest in new technologies and services that enhance user experience and operational efficiency. This aligns with Beard's (2024) emphasis on tech-sector renewal.
- **Repositioning**: Explore new market segments and geographical areas to expand the customer base. This could involve strategic partnerships or acquisitions to enhance service offerings.
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Engage with stakeholders, including customers, employees, and investors, to ensure that their needs and expectations are met. Freeman's (1984) stakeholder theory underscores the importance of aligning business strategies with stakeholder interests.
