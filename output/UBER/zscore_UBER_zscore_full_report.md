## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Uber Technologies, Inc. has maintained a positive liquidity position as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which measures the difference between current assets and current liabilities relative to total assets. The X1 values have remained above zero, suggesting that the company can cover its short-term obligations. However, the low values (e.g., 0.004 in Q1 2025) indicate that liquidity is tight, and there may be limited room for unexpected expenses.

### Profitability
The X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets) reflects the company's ability to generate earnings from its assets. The values are low but positive, indicating that while Uber is generating some earnings, the profitability is not robust. This could be a concern for long-term sustainability, especially in a competitive market.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) has shown negative values, indicating that Uber has not retained earnings effectively over time. This could reflect past losses or aggressive reinvestment strategies that have not yet yielded positive returns. This trend raises concerns about the company's ability to fund future growth without relying on external financing.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates a strong equity position relative to liabilities, with values consistently above 4.0. This suggests that Uber is not over-leveraged and has a solid capital structure, which is a positive sign for creditors and investors.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the safe zone (>2.90) over the last five quarters, with a score of 4.397 in Q1 2025. This indicates that Uber is not in immediate financial distress. However, the declining trend in profitability and liquidity metrics suggests that while the company is currently stable, it may face challenges if these trends continue.

## 2. Proposed Phased Response Using Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on the findings, Uber should focus on immediate retrenchment strategies to stabilize its financial health. This includes:
- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing cost-cutting measures to improve profitability. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on reducing operational costs during a turnaround.
- **Liquidity Management:** Enhancing cash flow management to ensure that short-term obligations are met. This is crucial given the tight liquidity position.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For sustainable growth, Uber should consider long-term repositioning strategies:
- **Market Diversification:** Exploring new markets or services to enhance revenue streams, as suggested by Hofer (1980).
- **Investment in Technology:** Continuing to invest in technology and innovation to improve operational efficiency and customer experience, aligning with Beard's (2024) insights on strategic renewal in technology firms.
