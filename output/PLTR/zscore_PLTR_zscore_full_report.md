## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

The purpose of this financial health analysis is to evaluate Palantir's liquidity, profitability, capital efficiency, and leverage, using the Altman Z-Score framework to assess its risk status.

### Liquidity
Palantir exhibits strong liquidity, with a **Current Ratio** of 6.49 and a **Quick Ratio** of 6.36, indicating a robust ability to cover short-term liabilities. This is significantly above the industry average, suggesting effective cash management.

### Profitability
The company has shown improvement in profitability metrics, with a **Gross Margin** of 80.01% and a **Net Margin** of 18.32%. The **Return on Assets (ROA)** stands at 4.39%, while the **Return on Equity (ROE)** is 12.36%, reflecting efficient use of assets and equity.

### Capital Efficiency
Palantir's **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** is 4.43, indicating a high level of leverage. While this can amplify returns, it also poses risks, especially in a volatile market. The company must manage its debt carefully to avoid financial distress.

### Z-Score Assessment
The Z-Score components indicate a moderate risk profile:
- **X1 (Working Capital/Total Assets)**: 0.79
- **X2 (Retained Earnings/Total Assets)**: -0.73
- **X3 (EBIT/Total Assets)**: 0.26
- **X4 (Market Value of Equity/Total Liabilities)**: 2.20
- **X5 (Sales/Total Assets)**: 0.46

The overall Z-Score suggests that while Palantir is not in immediate danger of bankruptcy, it must address its negative retained earnings and high debt levels to improve its financial stability.
