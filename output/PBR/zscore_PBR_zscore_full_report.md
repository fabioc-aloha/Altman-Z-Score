# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. - Petrobras (PBR)

---

## Company Profile

Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., commonly known as Petrobras, is a state-controlled oil and gas company headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It operates in the exploration, production, refining, and distribution of oil and natural gas, making it one of the largest oil companies in the world. Petrobras competes with other major players in the industry, including ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Royal Dutch Shell. The company is involved in various segments, including upstream (exploration and production), downstream (refining and distribution), and gas and power.

In recent years, Petrobras has faced significant challenges, including fluctuating oil prices, regulatory scrutiny, and operational inefficiencies. The company's financial health has been under pressure, leading to concerns about its ability to sustain operations and meet financial obligations. The Altman Z-Score analysis indicates that Petrobras is currently in the **Distress Zone**, suggesting a high risk of bankruptcy.

---

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Petrobras exhibits negative working capital, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects a current ratio below 1. This suggests that the company may struggle to meet short-term liabilities with its current assets. 

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT/Total Assets), indicate low operational efficiency, with EBIT margins under pressure due to high operational costs and fluctuating oil prices.

### Capital Efficiency
X2 (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) shows limited retained earnings, reflecting a lack of reinvestment into the business, which could hinder future growth and operational stability.

### Leverage
X4 (Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates a high level of leverage, suggesting that the company is heavily reliant on debt financing. This increases financial risk, especially in a volatile market.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score has consistently remained below the threshold of 1.81, indicating a persistent risk of financial distress. The trajectory shows a downward trend, emphasizing the need for immediate corrective actions.

---

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given that Petrobras is in the **Distress Zone**, the company must prioritize urgent retrenchment strategies. This includes:

- **Cash Preservation**: Implementing stringent cash flow management practices to ensure liquidity.
- **Cost Reduction**: Identifying non-essential expenditures and reducing operational costs to improve margins.
- **Creditor Negotiations**: Engaging with creditors to restructure debt obligations and extend repayment terms.

Relevant theoretical frameworks include:
- **Bibeault (1999)**: Emphasizes the importance of addressing operational inefficiencies and financial restructuring during distress.
- **Hofer (1980)**: Suggests a phased approach to turnaround, starting with immediate cash flow stabilization.

## 5. Plain-Language Justification & Citation

Petrobras is currently facing significant financial distress, as evidenced by its Z-Score of 0.502, which places it firmly in the Distress Zone. The company's negative working capital and high leverage indicate a critical need for immediate action to stabilize its financial position. Implementing cash preservation strategies and engaging in creditor negotiations are essential steps to avoid bankruptcy. These recommendations are grounded in established turnaround theories, emphasizing the urgency of addressing operational inefficiencies and financial restructuring.

## 6. Investor Recommendation (Risk-Aware)
