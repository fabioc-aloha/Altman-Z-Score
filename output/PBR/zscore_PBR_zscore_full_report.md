## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Petrobras has shown negative liquidity ratios, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects a current assets deficit relative to current liabilities. This suggests potential challenges in meeting short-term obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by the X3 component, indicate low earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to total assets. This trend raises concerns about the company's ability to generate sufficient profit from its asset base.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings (X2) are modest, indicating limited reinvestment into the company. This could hinder growth and innovation, especially in a competitive market.

### Leverage
The X4 component shows a relatively low equity-to-liabilities ratio, suggesting that the company is heavily leveraged. This increases financial risk, especially in volatile market conditions.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
The Z-Score for Petrobras has consistently remained in the Distress Zone, with the latest score at 0.502. This indicates a high risk of bankruptcy and financial instability, necessitating immediate attention to financial restructuring and operational efficiency.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given the company's current status in the **Distress Zone**, the focus must be on urgent retrenchment, cash preservation, and creditor negotiations. 

- **Urgent Retrenchment**: Implement cost-cutting measures across all departments to conserve cash.
- **Cash Preservation**: Prioritize liquidity by delaying non-essential capital expenditures and renegotiating payment terms with suppliers.
- **Creditor Negotiations**: Engage with creditors to restructure debt obligations, potentially seeking extensions or reductions in interest rates.

The application of Hofer's (1980) turnaround sequencing emphasizes the need for immediate action to stabilize the company's financial position. Bibeault (1999) highlights that addressing operational inefficiencies is crucial for recovery.
