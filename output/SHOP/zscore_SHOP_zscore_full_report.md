## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Shopify Inc. (SHOP) demonstrates a robust liquidity position, as indicated by its X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, which has consistently remained above 0.4 over the past five quarters. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, positioning it favorably in terms of liquidity.

### Profitability
The X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets) indicates a modest profitability level, with values around 0.015 to 0.033. While these figures are not exceptionally high, they reflect a stable operational performance. However, the company should focus on enhancing its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) to improve overall profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) has shown variability, with a notable dip into negative territory in Q2 2024. This raises concerns about the company's ability to retain earnings effectively, which could impact long-term sustainability and growth.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities) is exceptionally high, indicating a strong equity base relative to liabilities. This suggests that Shopify is not overly reliant on debt financing, which is a positive indicator of financial health and stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 42.057 to 60.583 over the past five quarters. This trend indicates that Shopify is not at immediate risk of bankruptcy and is in a strong financial position relative to its peers. However, the declining trend in the Z-Score from Q4 2024 to Q1 2025 warrants attention, as it suggests potential challenges ahead that could impact financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given the declining trend in the Z-Score, immediate retrenchment strategies should be implemented to stabilize the company's financial position. This includes:

- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing cost-cutting measures to improve profitability, as suggested by Bibeault (1999), who emphasizes the importance of reducing operational costs during financial distress.
- **Asset Management:** Evaluating and divesting non-core assets to improve liquidity and focus on core competencies (Hoskisson et al., 2004).

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term sustainability, Shopify should consider repositioning strategies, including:

- **Innovation and Product Development:** Investing in R&D to enhance product offerings and capture new market segments, aligning with Beard's (2024) emphasis on strategic renewal through innovation.
- **Market Expansion:** Exploring new geographic markets and customer segments to diversify revenue streams, as recommended by Hofer (1980) in his turnaround strategies.
