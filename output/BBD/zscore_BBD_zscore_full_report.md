# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations. For Banco Bradesco, the liquidity ratios such as the current ratio and quick ratio should be analyzed. A current ratio above 1 indicates that the company has more current assets than current liabilities, which is a positive sign. 

### Profitability
Profitability ratios, including return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA), provide insights into how effectively the company is generating profit from its resources. A consistent increase in these ratios over time would indicate strong financial health.

### Capital Efficiency
Capital efficiency ratios, such as asset turnover, measure how effectively a company is using its assets to generate revenue. A higher asset turnover ratio indicates better utilization of assets.

### Leverage
Leverage ratios, including debt-to-equity and interest coverage ratios, assess the company's financial risk. A lower debt-to-equity ratio is preferable, as it indicates less reliance on borrowed funds.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Altman Z-Score is a predictive measure of corporate bankruptcy risk. A Z-Score above 3 indicates a healthy company, while a score below 1.8 suggests a high risk of bankruptcy. The trend of the Z-Score over the past quarters will provide insights into whether the company's financial health is improving or deteriorating.

2. **Long-term Repositioning**: This involves strategic planning for sustainable growth, including market repositioning and innovation. Hofer (1980) emphasizes the importance of strategic renewal for long-term success.
