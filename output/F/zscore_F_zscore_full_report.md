# Altman Z-Score Analysis Report: Ford Motor Company (F)

## Company Profile

Ford Motor Company, headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, is a leading global automotive manufacturer known for its diverse range of vehicles, including trucks, SUVs, and luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. The company operates through several segments: Ford Blue, Ford Model e, Ford Pro, and Ford Credit, providing a comprehensive suite of products and services that includes internal combustion engine vehicles, electric vehicles, service parts, and financing solutions. 

In a competitive landscape dominated by other automotive giants such as General Motors and Toyota, Ford has been focusing on transitioning towards electric vehicles and enhancing its digital services. However, the company has faced challenges recently, including declining revenues and profitability, which have raised concerns among investors and analysts.

---

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ford's current ratio stands at 1.132, indicating that the company has slightly more current assets than current liabilities. However, this is marginal and suggests potential liquidity constraints, especially in a challenging market environment.

### Profitability
The company's profit margins are low, with a gross margin of 8.07% and an operating margin of 0.97%. The earnings growth rate is negative at -64%, reflecting significant challenges in maintaining profitability amidst rising costs and competitive pressures.

### Capital Efficiency
Ford's return on assets (ROA) is 0.98%, and return on equity (ROE) is 11.5%. These figures indicate that while the company is generating some returns, they are not sufficient to signal robust capital efficiency compared to industry benchmarks.

### Leverage
The debt-to-equity ratio is notably high at 353.30, indicating that Ford is heavily reliant on debt financing. This high leverage poses risks, particularly in an environment of rising interest rates or declining revenues.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score for Ford has consistently remained in the Distress Zone, with the most recent score at 0.473. This trajectory indicates a significant risk of bankruptcy and financial distress, necessitating urgent strategic interventions.

---

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Ford's current status in the **Distress Zone**, the focus should be on **urgent retrenchment**, cash preservation, and creditor negotiations. 

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Hofer (1980)** emphasizes the importance of a structured turnaround sequence, which Ford must adopt to stabilize its operations.
- **Bibeault (1999)** highlights the need to identify causes of failure, which for Ford include high leverage and declining profitability.
- **Hoskisson et al. (2004)** suggest strategic restructuring, which is critical for Ford to realign its operations and financial structure.
- **Freeman (1984)** underscores stakeholder alignment, which is essential for maintaining investor confidence during this turbulent period.

## 5. Plain-Language Justification & Citation

Ford's current financial situation necessitates urgent action to avoid further decline. The company's high leverage and low profitability signal a need for immediate cost-cutting and restructuring efforts. By following established turnaround theories, Ford can stabilize its operations and work towards a sustainable recovery.

---

## 6. Investor Recommendation (Risk-Aware)

**Recommendation:** **Sell**. Given the current Z-Score and financial health indicators, it is advisable for investors to divest until Ford demonstrates a clear turnaround strategy and improvement in financial metrics.
