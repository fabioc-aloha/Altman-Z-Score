## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |    X3 |    X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic    |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|---------------|

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
The liquidity position of Companhia de Saneamento BÃ¡sico (SBS) is concerning, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects the company's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with its current assets. The X1 value has been consistently low, indicating a potential liquidity crisis.

### Profitability
Profitability, represented by the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), is also weak. The declining EBIT suggests that the company is struggling to generate sufficient earnings from its assets, which is critical for sustaining operations and funding growth.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) shows that retained earnings are minimal relative to total assets, signaling that the company has not been able to reinvest profits effectively. This could hinder future growth and financial stability.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) indicates a high level of leverage, which is concerning. A low equity-to-liabilities ratio suggests that the company is heavily reliant on debt, increasing financial risk and vulnerability to economic downturns.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently fallen into the "Distress Zone," with a score of 0.967 in Q3 2024, indicating a high risk of bankruptcy. The trend shows a downward trajectory, which is alarming and necessitates immediate action to avert financial collapse.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Based on Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies, SBS should implement immediate retrenchment measures to stabilize its financial position. This includes:
- **Cost Reduction:** Identify and eliminate non-essential expenditures.
- **Asset Liquidation:** Sell underperforming or non-core assets to improve liquidity.
- **Debt Restructuring:** Negotiate with creditors to restructure existing debt obligations.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For sustainable recovery, SBS should focus on long-term repositioning strategies as outlined by Bibeault (1999) and Hoskisson et al. (2004):
- **Market Reassessment:** Analyze market trends and customer needs to realign services.
- **Innovation Investment:** Invest in technology and process improvements to enhance operational efficiency.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Foster relationships with stakeholders to build trust and support for strategic initiatives.
