# Graphical View of the Z-Score Analysis

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
NVIDIA Corporation demonstrates strong liquidity, with a current ratio (X1) consistently above 0.5, indicating that the company can cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. The current ratio has shown a slight upward trend from 0.513 in Q1 2024 to 0.556 in Q1 2025, suggesting improved liquidity management.

### Profitability
The profitability of NVIDIA is reflected in its EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) to total assets ratio (X3), which has remained stable around 0.227 to 0.233 over the last five quarters. This indicates that the company is effectively generating earnings relative to its asset base, contributing positively to its overall financial health.

### Capital Efficiency
NVIDIA's retained earnings (X2) as a percentage of total assets have shown a positive trend, increasing from 0.454 in Q1 2024 to 0.61 in Q1 2025. This growth signifies that the company is retaining more of its earnings, which can be reinvested into operations or used to strengthen its balance sheet.

### Leverage
The market value of equity to total liabilities ratio (X4) has been exceptionally high, peaking at 107.497 in Q4 2024 and remaining above 90 in Q1 2025. This indicates that NVIDIA is not heavily leveraged, which is a positive sign for financial stability.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with values ranging from 41.857 to 67.059 over the last five quarters. The latest Z-Score of 57.054 in Q1 2025 indicates a strong financial position, suggesting that NVIDIA is well-positioned to avoid bankruptcy and can focus on growth and innovation.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given NVIDIA's strong financial health, immediate retrenchment is not necessary. However, the company should continue to monitor its operational efficiency and cost management to ensure that profitability remains robust. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on cost control during periods of financial stability.

### Long-Term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, NVIDIA should focus on innovation and market expansion, particularly in AI and machine learning sectors. Hofer (1980) suggests that companies in a strong financial position should leverage their resources for strategic growth. This can be achieved through:

- **Investment in R&D:** To maintain its competitive edge in technology.
- **Market Diversification:** Exploring new markets and applications for its products.
