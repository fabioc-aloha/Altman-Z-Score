## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
NVIDIA's liquidity position is robust, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, which has consistently remained above 0.5 across the analyzed quarters. This suggests that the company has sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities, indicating a strong liquidity position.

### Profitability
The profitability of NVIDIA is reflected in the X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets), which has shown a steady performance, hovering around 0.227 to 0.233. This indicates that the company is effectively generating earnings before interest and taxes relative to its total asset base, showcasing operational efficiency.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) demonstrates NVIDIA's ability to retain earnings for reinvestment. The values range from 0.454 to 0.61, indicating a healthy retention of earnings that supports growth and stability.

### Leverage
NVIDIA's leverage is assessed through the X4 component (Market Value of Equity / Total Liabilities), which has shown an impressive upward trend, reaching 90.722 in Q1 2025. This indicates that the market values the company significantly higher than its liabilities, suggesting a low risk of financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given NVIDIA's strong financial health, immediate retrenchment is not necessary. However, it is essential to maintain vigilance in operational efficiency and cost management to safeguard against potential market volatility. According to Hofer (1980), maintaining a focus on core competencies and optimizing resource allocation can enhance resilience.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, NVIDIA should leverage its technological advancements and market leadership in AI and graphics processing. Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of innovation and strategic renewal in sustaining competitive advantage. Implementing agile practices (Beard, 2024) can facilitate rapid adaptation to market changes and foster a culture of continuous improvement.
