## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
- **Current Ratio (X1)**: The current ratio has shown a slight increase from 0.065 in Q1 2024 to 0.045 in Q1 2025, indicating a stable liquidity position. This suggests that SAP has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities, which is crucial for short-term financial health.

### Profitability
- **Retained Earnings (X2)**: The retained earnings as a percentage of total assets have remained relatively stable, indicating that SAP is effectively reinvesting its profits. The value increased from 0.571 in Q1 2024 to 0.591 in Q1 2025, reflecting a solid profitability trend.

### Capital Efficiency
- **EBIT (X3)**: The EBIT to total assets ratio has shown improvement, moving from -0.01 in Q1 2024 to 0.036 in Q1 2025. This indicates that SAP is becoming more efficient in generating earnings from its assets.

### Leverage
- **Market Value of Equity to Total Liabilities (X4)**: The ratio has increased from 7.597 in Q1 2024 to 10.6 in Q1 2025, suggesting that SAP is effectively managing its leverage and has a strong equity base relative to its liabilities.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a value of 13.597 in Q1 2025, indicating that SAP is financially healthy and not at risk of bankruptcy. The upward trend in the Z-Score over the quarters reflects improved financial stability and operational efficiency.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
- **Cost Reduction**: Implement immediate cost-cutting measures in non-essential areas to improve cash flow. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on immediate financial stabilization during a turnaround.
- **Asset Liquidation**: Evaluate underperforming assets for potential sale to generate liquidity, as suggested by Hofer (1980).

### Long-term Repositioning
- **Strategic Innovation**: Invest in R&D to enhance product offerings and maintain competitive advantage, as outlined by Beard (2024).
- **Market Expansion**: Explore new markets and customer segments to diversify revenue streams, following Hoskisson et al. (2004) recommendations for strategic renewal.
