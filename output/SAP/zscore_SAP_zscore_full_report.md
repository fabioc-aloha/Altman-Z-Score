## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |     X3 |     X4 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic   |

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
SAP's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, shows a steady increase from 0.065 in Q1 2024 to 0.045 in Q1 2025. This suggests that the company is effectively managing its short-term obligations, maintaining a healthy buffer against potential liquidity crises.

### Profitability
The profitability metric (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) has shown fluctuations, with a notable decrease to 0.036 in Q1 2025 from 0.034 in Q3 2024. This indicates a potential concern regarding operational efficiency, as the company may be facing challenges in converting assets into earnings.

### Capital Efficiency
The retained earnings ratio (X2: Retained Earnings / Total Assets) has remained relatively stable, hovering around 0.591 in Q1 2025. This stability suggests that SAP is effectively reinvesting profits back into the business, which is a positive sign for long-term growth.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4: Equity / Total Liabilities) is exceptionally high at 10.6 in Q1 2025, indicating that SAP is primarily financed through equity rather than debt. This low leverage reduces financial risk and enhances the company's ability to withstand economic downturns.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score for SAP has consistently remained in the "Safe Zone," with a score of 13.597 in Q1 2025. This trend indicates strong financial health and a low probability of bankruptcy. The company has demonstrated resilience and effective management of its financial resources, positioning itself favorably against competitors in the software industry.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
Given the slight decline in profitability, SAP should consider immediate retrenchment strategies to enhance operational efficiency. This could involve cost-cutting measures, streamlining operations, and focusing on core competencies. According to Hofer (1980), such strategies can stabilize the company in the short term and prevent further declines in profitability.

### Long-term Repositioning
For long-term repositioning, SAP should invest in innovation and technology to enhance its product offerings and market competitiveness. Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of strategic renewal in turnaround situations. This could involve exploring new markets, developing new products, and leveraging emerging technologies to drive growth.
