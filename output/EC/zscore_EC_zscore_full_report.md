## Company Profile

Ecopetrol S.A., headquartered in Bogotá, Colombia, is the largest petroleum company in the country and one of the largest in Latin America. The company is primarily engaged in the exploration, production, refining, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas. Ecopetrol operates in a highly competitive environment, facing challenges from both domestic and international players in the energy sector, including companies like Pacific Rubiales and Gran Tierra Energy. Its product offerings include crude oil, natural gas, and refined products, which are critical to meeting the energy demands of Colombia and the broader region.

Recent financial performance indicates significant challenges, as evidenced by the company's Z-Score, which places it firmly in the Distress Zone. This status suggests that Ecopetrol is facing serious financial difficulties, necessitating immediate strategic interventions to stabilize its operations and restore investor confidence.

---

## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ecopetrol's liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets, is weak at 0.07. This suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations, which is concerning given the volatility in oil prices and operational costs.

### Profitability
The profitability metric (X3: EBIT / Total Assets) stands at 0.04, reflecting low operational efficiency and profitability. This is below industry benchmarks, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient earnings relative to its asset base.

### Capital Efficiency
The capital efficiency ratio (X5: Sales / Total Assets) is also low at 0.117, suggesting that Ecopetrol is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate sales. This inefficiency can hinder growth and profitability.

### Leverage
The leverage ratio (X4: Equity / Total Liabilities) is reported at 0, indicating that the company is heavily reliant on debt financing. This high leverage increases financial risk, especially in a downturn.

### Z-Score Trajectory
The Z-Score has consistently remained in the Distress Zone, with a score of 0.39 in the latest quarter. This trajectory indicates a deteriorating financial condition, necessitating urgent corrective measures.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application (Risk-Tailored)

Given Ecopetrol's classification in the **Distress Zone**, the following phased response is recommended:

### Urgent Retrenchment
- **Cash Preservation**: Implement strict cash management practices to conserve liquidity. This includes delaying non-essential capital expenditures and renegotiating payment terms with suppliers.
- **Cost Reduction**: Identify and eliminate non-essential expenses. This may involve workforce reductions, operational efficiencies, and renegotiating contracts to lower costs.

### Creditor Negotiations
- **Engage with Creditors**: Proactively communicate with creditors to negotiate more favorable terms or restructuring of existing debt. This aligns with Bibeault's (1999) emphasis on addressing financial distress through stakeholder engagement.

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Hofer (1980)**: Emphasizes the need for a structured turnaround strategy that prioritizes immediate financial stability.
- **Freeman (1984)**: Highlights the importance of stakeholder alignment, which is crucial during distress to maintain support from creditors, employees, and customers.

## 5. Plain-Language Justification & Citation
