## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ecopetrol's liquidity position is concerning, as indicated by a low X1 ratio (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets. This suggests that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations, which is critical in the volatile oil and gas industry.

### Profitability
The profitability metrics, represented by X3 (EBIT / Total Assets), are also weak, indicating that the company is not generating sufficient earnings relative to its asset base. This could be a result of declining oil prices or operational inefficiencies.

### Capital Efficiency
The capital efficiency, measured by X5 (Sales / Total Assets), shows limited sales generation relative to total assets, which raises concerns about the company's operational effectiveness.

### Leverage
Ecopetrol's leverage, indicated by X4 (Equity / Total Liabilities), is alarmingly low, suggesting a high level of debt relative to equity. This increases financial risk and may limit the company's ability to secure additional financing.

### Z-Score Trajectory and Risk Status
Based on the Altman Z-Score calculations, Ecopetrol is firmly in the **Distress Zone**, with a Z-Score of 0.39. This indicates a high risk of bankruptcy and necessitates immediate action to stabilize the company's financial health.

## 2. Turnaround & Renewal Theory Application

Given Ecopetrol's **Distress Zone** status, the company must prioritize **urgent retrenchment** strategies. This includes cash preservation measures and negotiations with creditors to restructure debt obligations. 

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Hofer (1980)** emphasizes the importance of a structured turnaround sequence, which Ecopetrol should adopt to stabilize operations.
- **Bibeault (1999)** highlights the causes of failure, suggesting that Ecopetrol must address operational inefficiencies and market positioning to recover.
- **Hoskisson et al. (2004)** advocate for strategic restructuring, which is essential for Ecopetrol to realign its business model with market demands.

## 5. Investor Recommendation (Risk-Aware)
