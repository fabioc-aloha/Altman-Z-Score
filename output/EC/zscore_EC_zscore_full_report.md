## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |    X3 |   X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic    |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 2024 Q4   | 0.07  | 0.041 | 0.04  |    0 | 0.117 |     0.39  | Distress Zone |
| 2024 Q2   | 0.071 | 0.018 | 0.037 |    0 | 0.115 |     0.349 | Distress Zone |
## Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ecopetrol S.A. (EC) exhibits a concerning liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which reflects the company's current assets relative to its total assets. The X1 value of 0.07 suggests that the company has limited current assets available to cover its current liabilities, indicating potential cash flow issues.

### Profitability
The profitability metric, represented by the X3 component (EBIT/Total Assets), is also low at 0.04. This indicates that the company is generating minimal earnings before interest and taxes relative to its asset base, which raises concerns about operational efficiency and profitability.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings/Total Assets) at 0.041 indicates that a small portion of the company's assets is financed through retained earnings, suggesting a reliance on external financing and limited reinvestment of profits into the business.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity/Total Liabilities) is at 0, indicating that the company has no equity cushion to absorb losses, which heightens the risk of insolvency. This lack of equity financing can lead to increased financial distress, especially in volatile market conditions.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score of 0.39 places Ecopetrol firmly in the distress zone, signaling a high probability of bankruptcy. The downward trend in the Z-Score from 0.349 in Q2 2024 to 0.39 in Q4 2024 indicates deteriorating financial health, necessitating immediate action to avert potential insolvency.

## Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Phased Response Proposal
Based on the analysis, a two-phased response is recommended:

1. **Immediate Retrenchment**: This phase focuses on cost-cutting measures, asset liquidation, and improving cash flow. Key actions include:
   - Reducing operational costs through workforce optimization and renegotiating supplier contracts.
   - Selling non-core assets to generate liquidity.
   - Implementing stricter credit controls to manage receivables.

2. **Long-term Repositioning**: This phase aims at strategic renewal and repositioning the company for sustainable growth. Key actions include:
   - Investing in technology and innovation to enhance operational efficiency.
   - Diversifying product offerings to reduce dependency on crude oil prices.
   - Exploring strategic partnerships or joint ventures to leverage external expertise and resources.

These strategies align with Hofer's (1980) turnaround strategies and Bibeault's (1999) corporate turnaround principles, emphasizing the need for both immediate and long-term actions to restore financial health.
