## Z-Score Component Table (by Quarter)
| Quarter   |    X1 |    X2 |    X3 |   X4 |    X5 |   Z-Score | Diagnostic    | Consistency Warning   |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|------|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------------|
| 2024 Q4   | 0.07  | 0.041 | 0.04  |    0 | 0.117 |     0.39  | Distress Zone |                       |
| 2024 Q2   | 0.071 | 0.018 | 0.037 |    0 | 0.115 |     0.349 | Distress Zone |                       |
## 1. Diagnostic Evaluation of Financial Health

### Liquidity
Ecopetrol S.A. (EC) exhibits a concerning liquidity position, as indicated by the X1 component of the Z-Score, which is calculated as (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets. The values of 0.07 and 0.071 for the last two quarters suggest that the company is struggling to cover its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets. This raises a red flag regarding its ability to meet immediate financial obligations.

### Profitability
The profitability measure, represented by the X3 component (EBIT / Total Assets), is also low, with values of 0.04 and 0.037. This indicates that the company is generating insufficient earnings relative to its asset base, which could hinder its ability to reinvest in operations or pay down debt.

### Capital Efficiency
The X2 component (Retained Earnings / Total Assets) is at 0.041 and 0.018, reflecting a declining trend in retained earnings relative to total assets. This suggests that the company is not effectively utilizing its assets to generate profits, which is critical for long-term sustainability.

### Leverage
The X4 component (Equity / Total Liabilities) is at 0, indicating that the company has no equity cushion to absorb losses. This is a significant concern, as it implies that the company is highly leveraged and vulnerable to financial distress.

### Z-Score Trend Interpretation
The Z-Score has been consistently in the distress zone, with values of 0.39 and 0.349 for the last two quarters. This trend indicates a high likelihood of bankruptcy in the near future, necessitating immediate action to stabilize the company's financial health.

## 2. Turnaround and Renewal Management Theory Application

### Immediate Retrenchment
According to Hofer (1980), immediate retrenchment strategies are essential for companies in distress. This involves cutting costs, reducing workforce, and divesting non-core assets. For Ecopetrol, this could mean:

- **Cost Reduction:** Implementing strict cost control measures to improve liquidity.
- **Asset Divestiture:** Selling off non-essential assets to generate cash.

### Long-term Repositioning
Bibeault (1999) emphasizes the importance of long-term strategies for sustainable recovery. Ecopetrol should focus on:

- **Strategic Renewal:** Investing in technology and innovation to improve operational efficiency (Beard, 2024).
- **Market Repositioning:** Exploring new markets or diversifying product offerings to enhance revenue streams.
