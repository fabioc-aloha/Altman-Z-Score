# Altman Z-Score Unified Project Plan & TODO (2025)

## Vision Alignment

> Our goal is to deliver an Altman Z-Score platform that not only matches but surpasses the capabilities of all current and future competitors—open-source or commercial. Every feature, architectural decision, and user experience is designed to set a new industry standard for transparency, extensibility, and actionable financial insight.

See [vision.md](./vision.md) for the full vision statement.

## Completed Milestones

### v3.0.1 (2025-06-07) ✅ FULLY COMPLETED
- Full modular reorganization: All code grouped by functionality (core, models, company, validation, market, plotting, computation, misc)
- All imports fixed: Updated to use new modular paths

- Critical import fixes: Resolved all ModuleNotFoundError issues
- Main pipeline verified: Successfully runs `python main.py msft` without import errors
- Improved LLM prompt templates: Enhanced code injection for reporting
- Documentation updated: All documentation reflects new structure and completed modularization

- Export format extensions (Excel, PowerBI, PDF)
- Custom notification system for Z-Score threshold alerts

### Data & Analysis Extensions
- Currency conversion for non-USD firms
- "What-if" scenario analysis for financial planning
- Advanced forecasting using consensus estimates
- Industry-specific model calibration refinements

### Integration & API Features
- REST API for programmatic access
- Database backend for historical data storage
- Third-party tool integrations

## Project Architecture & Implementation Principles

### Core Architecture
1. **Input Layer:** Accepts ticker(s) and analysis date; validates input
2. **Data Fetching Layer:** Fetches financials (SEC EDGAR/XBRL) and market data (Yahoo Finance, Finnhub)
3. **Validation Layer:** Validates raw data using Pydantic schemas; reports missing/invalid fields
4. **Computation Layer:** Computes Altman Z-Score using validated data; returns result object
5. **Reporting Layer:** Outputs results to CSV, JSON, or stdout; logs all steps and errors

### Implementation Principles
- **Simplicity:** Start with single-stock analysis, then generalize to portfolios
- **Modularity:** Clean separation of data fetching, validation, computation, and reporting
- **Testability:** Each module independently testable with clear interfaces
- **Robustness:** Strong error handling, logging, and data validation
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new data sources, models, or output formats

### Development Philosophy
- Build robust MVPs before adding features
- Test thoroughly at each step
- Enable features incrementally with full testing and documentation
- Prioritize reliability and maintainability
- Follow conservative change management practices

## Technical Maintenance & References

### DRY Compliance & Code Quality
- Centralized constants, error handling, and configuration
- DRY-compliant API integration for Yahoo Finance, SEC EDGAR, Finnhub
- Modular components with well-defined interfaces
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Consistent documentation style across all modules and APIs

### Key Technical Reference Files
- Centralized error handling: `error_helpers.py`
- Field mapping constants: `computation/constants.py`
- LLM prompt templates: `src/prompts/`
- API endpoint configuration: client classes (`sec_client.py`, `yahoo_client.py`, etc.)
- Test data & fixtures: `tests/` directory

### API Documentation
See `APIS.md` for detailed documentation of all external APIs used in this project, including:
- SEC EDGAR API for financial data
- Yahoo Finance API for market data
- Finnhub API for company profiles and logos
- LLM APIs for qualitative analysis

---

## Prompt & LLM Customization
- All LLM prompt files are in `src/prompts/`—edit to customize LLM behavior, add new features, or update instructions
- Ensure prompt changes are reflected in all outputs (test with unique phrase as described below)
- Expand/normalize FIELD_SYNONYMS for all canonical fields, especially for banks and international companies
- Implement sector/industry/ticker awareness in mapping logic (e.g., map 'sales' to 'Interest Income' for banks)
- Allow user to provide mapping override file (e.g., mapping_overrides.json)
- Add granular logging and fallback logic for mapping decisions

#### Prompt Testing Workflow
1. Edit `prompt_fin_analysis.md` and add a unique phrase
2. Run the pipeline for any ticker
3. Check the output report for the phrase
4. Revert the prompt

---

## API Integrations
### Finnhub Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- Research finnhub.io and its API for potential integration (evaluate data coverage, cost, and API limits)
- https://finnhub.io/docs/api
- https://github.com/Finnhub-Stock-API/finnhub-python
- Integrated finnhub for company profile and logo fetching (see src/altman_zscore/api/finnhub_client.py)
- All code and documentation updated to reflect Finnhub integration and logo fetching

## Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# Required: SEC EDGAR access
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT="AltmanZScore/1.0 name@domain.com"  # Use your own contact email

# Optional: Yahoo Finance (if using premium API)
YAHOO_FINANCE_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # Do NOT share real API keys

# Optional: Finnhub (required for company profiles/logos)
FINNHUB_API_KEY="your-finnhub-api-key"  # Do NOT share real API keys
```

> **Security Note:** Never commit or share real API keys, secrets, or credentials in documentation, code, or version control. Always use placeholder values (e.g., "your-api-key") and store secrets securely using environment variables or secret managers.

# Directive: AI-First Solutions
- Always prefer AI-powered, LLM-based, or AI-assisted solutions for field mapping, data reconciliation, and similar tasks, unless a simpler, more robust, or more transparent method is clearly superior for the use case.
- When implementing new features or refactoring, prioritize AI-first approaches in line with KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Document any decision to use a non-AI method in TODO.md or LEARNINGS.md, including rationale.
