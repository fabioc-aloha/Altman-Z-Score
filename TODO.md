# Altman Z-Score Project Improvements

This document serves as the active project roadmap and task tracking system. It is the primary source for:
- Current project priorities
- Active sprint tasks
- Implementation status
- Completion tracking

For large-scale changes that affect multiple modules or carry significant risks:
1. Check DECISIONS.md for architectural guidelines
2. Create a detailed PLAN.md before implementation
3. Follow implementation steps in PLAN.md
4. Update task status here as work progresses
