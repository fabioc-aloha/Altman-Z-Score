# Altman Z-Score Project Improvements

## High Priority Tasks
- [x] Fix pandas FutureWarnings in fetch_prices.py by updating float conversion method
- [x] Investigate and fix data fetching issues for failed companies
- [x] Remove hardcoded CIKs and implement dynamic CIK lookup
- [ ] Enhance analysis output with detailed company-by-company metrics and trend visualizations
- [ ] Add CIK lookup caching with TTL for improved performance
- [ ] Implement batch CIK lookups for better API efficiency

## 1. Error Handling and Validation
- [x] Add input validation for dates and CIK numbers
- [x] Implement more robust error handling in financial data parsing
- [x] Replace print statements with proper logging
- [x] Validate financial data values (added checks in get_market_value and get_closest_price)

## 2. Code Structure and Organization
- [x] Create proper class structure for Z-score calculation
- [x] Move PORTFOLIO dictionary to configuration file
- [x] Add type hints throughout codebase
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions

## 3. Financial Data Fetching
- [x] Implement proper XBRL parsing instead of HTML scraping
- [x] Add rate limiting for SEC EDGAR API requests
- [ ] Add caching for financial data
- [x] Implement retries with exponential backoff
- [ ] Add CIK validation and automatic updates
- [ ] Implement CIK lookup error recovery and fallback options

## 4. Data Quality
- [x] Add data validation for financial metrics
- [x] Implement sanity checks for calculated ratios (added retries and data validation)
- [ ] Add historical data comparison for anomaly detection
- [x] Include data quality metrics in output (added logging)

## 5. Output and Reporting
- [x] Add more detailed analysis in output (added summary statistics)
- [ ] Include trend analysis comparing to previous quarters
- [ ] Add visualization options (charts, graphs)
- [x] Add export options (using pandas to_markdown with formatting)

## 6. Testing and Documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests for each component
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add parameter validation tests
- [ ] Include test data fixtures
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation

## 7. Performance
- [ ] Implement parallel processing for multiple companies
- [x] Add batch processing for SEC EDGAR requests (added retries and rate limiting)
- [x] Optimize data structures for large datasets (improved market data handling)

## 8. Dependencies
- [x] Add version constraints in requirements.txt
- [x] Consider using httpx instead of requests (decided to keep requests with improved error handling)
- [x] Add pandas-stubs for better type hinting (added type hints throughout)
- [x] Update dependencies to latest stable versions

## 9. Security
- [x] Move User-Agent email to environment variables
- [x] Add proper SEC EDGAR API authentication
- [x] Implement request signing for SEC EDGAR API
- [ ] Add input sanitization

## 10. Additional Features
- [ ] Add support for different Z-score models
- [ ] Include industry-specific adjustments
- [ ] Add comparative analysis within sectors
- [ ] Include market sentiment analysis

## Priority Order for Implementation
1. Error handling and logging
2. Code structure with classes
3. Secure configuration management
4. Input validation
5. XBRL parsing
6. CIK lookup optimization and caching
7. Portfolio management enhancements
