**Release v2.2.2 (May 29, 2025):**
- Script version is now included in every report for traceability
- Tested companies documentation and release process are enforced
- Documentation, outputs, and release workflow streamlined and up to date

## Usage
To analyze a stock, run:
```sh
python main.py <TICKER>
```
Replace `<TICKER>` with the stock ticker symbol (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`).

Outputs are saved in `output/<TICKER>/`:
- Full report: `zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_full_report.md`
- Trend chart: `zscore_<TICKER>_trend.png`
- Raw data: `zscore_<TICKER>.csv` and `.json`
- If a ticker is not available, only a `TICKER_NOT_AVAILABLE.txt` marker file will be present.
