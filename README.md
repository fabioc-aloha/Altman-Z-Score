### Key Features
- **Single-Stock Z-Score Trend Analysis**: Computes and visualizes Altman Z-Score trends for any US-listed equity using only real, live data (no static/hardcoded values).
- **Enhanced Price Trend Visualization**: Features monthly price statistics overlay with whiskers showing:
  - Monthly average price points
  - High-low ranges visualized as whiskers
  - Transparent overlay for easy Z-Score trend comparison
  - Per-month data point counts for transparency
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles delisted, missing, or invalid tickers (e.g., RIDE, JHKASD), saving user-friendly error reports and exiting cleanly without stack traces.
- **Minimal Console Output**: Only essential information, warnings, and errors are shown; all debug output is suppressed.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Output files and charts include company profile, SIC code, and model details in footnotes.
- **Full Analysis Report Output**: For each analysis, a comprehensive, well-formatted report is generated and saved as `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_full_report.txt`. This file includes:
  - Context and model selection details
  - Raw data field mapping table (values in millions of USD)
  - Z-Score component table with risk area diagnostics for each quarter
  - All formulas and calculation details
  - This is the main reference for interpreting results and auditability.
- **Other Output Files**:
  - `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_summary.txt`: Table summary of all computed quarters
  - `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_profile.txt`: Company profile and classification
  - `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>.csv` and `.json`: Raw results for further analysis
  - `output/<TICKER>/quarterly_prices_<TICKER>.csv` and `.json`: Quarterly price data used in the analysis
  - `output/<TICKER>/monthly_prices_<TICKER>.csv` and `.json`: Monthly price statistics (avg, min, max)
  - `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_trend.png`: Z-Score trend chart with enhanced price overlay and monthly statistics
- **Professional Documentation**: All core modules have complete module-level docstrings, public functions/classes are fully documented, and non-obvious logic is explained with inline comments.
- **Environment Flexibility**: Compatible with both GitHub Codespaces and local Python virtual environments. See `docs/venv_setup.md` for local setup instructions. Uses `pyproject.toml` for dependencies.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Clean separation of input, data fetching, validation, computation, and reporting layers. Easy to add new models, data sources, or output formats.

## Usage
To analyze a stock, run:
```pwsh
python main.py <TICKER>
```
Replace `<TICKER>` with the stock ticker symbol you want to analyze (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`).

Example:
```pwsh
python main.py AAPL
```

Outputs will be saved in the `output/<TICKER>/` directory:
- Full report: `zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_full_report.txt`
- Component table: `zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_components.txt`
- Trend chart: `zscore_<TICKER>_trend.png`
- Raw data: `zscore_<TICKER>.csv` and `.json`
- Profile/summary: `zscore_<TICKER>_profile.txt`

Reports include mapped industry, SIC code, model selection rationale, and risk diagnostics for each quarter. Charts show Z-Score trends with risk zones and optional price overlay.

## Typical Workflow
1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Set Up Your Environment** (see below)
3. **Run the Analysis Pipeline** for a ticker (see Usage above)
4. **Review Outputs** in the output directory
5. **Interpret Results** using the generated reports and charts

---

## Advanced Usage
- **Custom Analysis:** Extend the pipeline to new models, data sources, or output formats by following the modular structure
- **Batch/Portfolio Analysis:** (Planned for v2.5+) Analyze multiple tickers or portfolios with a single command
- **Forecasting & Sentiment:** (v2.5 Roadmap) Integrate consensus estimates and news sentiment for forward-looking risk analysis

=======
    - `SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT`: Required. Your SEC EDGAR User-Agent string (format: `Project/Version (your@email.com) Python-Requests/3.0`).
    - `SEC_API_EMAIL`: Required. Your contact email for SEC API access.

- Optional variables are provided for additional data sources (Yahoo Finance, NewsAPI, etc.) and cache configuration.
=======
### Environment Variables
The project uses a `.env` file in the root directory to manage API keys and configuration. For security, your real `.env` should never be committed to version control. Instead, use the provided `.env.example` as a template:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project root.
2. Fill in your real credentials and configuration values.
>>>>>>> ce65ac8 (Release version 2.0 with updated documentation and features)

Example:
```
SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=AltmanZScore/1.0 (your@email.com) Python-Requests/3.0
SEC_API_EMAIL=your@email.com
```

### Python Virtual Environment Setup
- This project uses a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) for dependency management and isolation.
- Requires Python 3.11+.
- See `docs/venv_setup.md` for detailed instructions on setting up and activating the virtual environment.

---

## Usage

### Setup
1. Install Python 3.11+ if not already installed.
2. Activate your `.venv` and install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your `.env` file as described above.

### Run Analysis
To analyze a stock, use the CLI in `main.py`:
```sh
python main.py <TICKER>
```
Replace `<TICKER>` with the stock ticker symbol you want to analyze (e.g., `AAPL`, `MSFT`).

#### Example
```sh
python main.py MSFT --start 2023-01-01
```
This will generate the Z-Score trend analysis for Microsoft starting from January 1, 2023, and save the results in the `output/` directory.

---

## Outputs
- **Full Analysis Report**: `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_zscore_full_report.txt`
- **Summary and Profile**: `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_summary.txt`, `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_profile.txt`
- **Raw Data**: CSV and JSON files for Z-Score components and price data.
- **Trend Chart**: `output/<TICKER>/zscore_<TICKER>_trend.png` with enhanced price overlay.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### Delisted and Nonexistent Companies
- The pipeline uses only real, live data from SEC EDGAR and Yahoo Finance. If a ticker is delisted, has changed symbols, or is not found in public data sources, the analysis will fail gracefully and save a user-friendly error report. However, for some delisted companies, especially those with no recent filings or market data, it may not be possible to retrieve any financials or price history. In these cases, the output will indicate the data gap and the analysis will not proceed.
- Some tickers (e.g., RIDE, JHKASD) may have partial or missing data due to the timing of delisting, bankruptcy, or symbol changes. The pipeline will report these cases clearly, but cannot fill in missing data from static or unofficial sources.
- If a company has changed its ticker or CIK, you may need to research the new symbol or CIK manually.

### Other Limitations
- **SIC/Industry Mapping**: Model selection is based on SIC code and industry mapping from public sources. This may not always reflect the true business maturity or sector (e.g., Rivian is classified as "mature" due to SIC 3711, but is a growth-stage company).
- **Quarterly Data Gaps**: If a company has missing or irregular quarterly filings, the Z-Score trend may have gaps or fewer data points.
- **International Companies**: The pipeline is designed for US-listed equities. Non-US companies or ADRs may have incomplete or inconsistent data.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Only single-ticker analysis is supported in the MVP. Portfolio and multi-ticker support is planned for future versions.
- **News/Sentiment**: Sentiment and news analysis are not included in the MVP, but are planned for future releases.
- **Data Source Reliability**: All results depend on the accuracy and availability of public APIs and data sources. Outages or changes in data provider APIs may temporarily affect functionality.

For more details on edge cases and technical learnings, see `LEARNINGS.md` and the project Wiki.
