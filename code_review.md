# Code Review Checklist: main.py (v2.8.5)

## Completed
- [x] Deep nesting in main loop reduced (moved Z-Score result formatting to a helper function for clarity and maintainability)
- [x] Redundant result printing fixed (moved print loop outside formatting loop)
- [x] Hardcoded output paths replaced with os.path.join for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] PEP 8 compliance ensured (4-space indentation, blank lines, docstrings, and line length)

## Outstanding (Detailed)
- [ ] **Unused Imports:**
    - Review all imports (argparse, os, sys, time, pandas, custom modules) and remove any that are not used in the script.
- [ ] All imports are at the top of the file, as required by PEP 8
- [ ] **No Unit Test Invocation:**
    - Add a `--test` CLI flag to allow running the test suite directly from main.py for developer convenience.
    - Document this feature in the usage/help text.
- [ ] **No Logging:**
    - Integrate Python's `logging` module for status, info, warning, and error messages instead of print statements.
    - Allow log level configuration via CLI or environment variable.
- [ ] **No Progress Indicator:**
    - For multi-ticker analysis, add a progress bar (e.g., using `tqdm`) to show progress through the ticker list.
    - Make this optional or auto-disable for single-ticker runs.
- [ ] **No Input Validation for Dates:**
    - Validate the `--start` argument to ensure it matches the YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - Provide a clear error message and exit if the format is invalid.
- [ ] **No Exit Code on Failure:**
    - Track if any ticker fails during analysis.
    - Return a non-zero exit code if any failures occur, for better automation and CI/CD integration.
- [ ] **Docstring Updates:**
    - Update the main module and function docstrings to explicitly mention:
        - The modular structure (input, data fetching, validation, computation, reporting)
        - The robust error handling approach
        - The extensibility and testability principles
