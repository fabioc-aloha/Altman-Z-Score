# Code Review Checklist: main.py (v2.8.5)

## Completed
- [x] Deep nesting in main loop reduced (moved Z-Score result formatting to a helper function for clarity and maintainability)
- [x] Redundant result printing fixed (moved print loop outside formatting loop)
- [x] Hardcoded output paths replaced with os.path.join for cross-platform compatibility
- [x] PEP 8 compliance ensured (4-space indentation, blank lines, docstrings, and line length)
- [x] All imports are at the top of the file, as required by PEP 8 (with justified exceptions for circular import avoidance)
- [x] Unused Imports: All imports in the codebase are used and necessary
- [x] **Unit Test Invocation:**
    - `--test` CLI flag added to allow running the test suite directly from main.py for developer convenience.
    - Documented in the usage/help text.
- [x] **Logging:**
    - Integrated Python's `logging` module for all status, info, warning, and error messages instead of print statements.
    - Logging is now enforced in all modules (main, reporting, utils, computation, models, etc.).
    - All print_* functions in utils/terminal.py now raise NotImplementedError to enforce logging usage.
    - All error helpers and I/O utilities log errors before raising exceptions.
- [x] **Log Level Configuration:**
    - Log level can be set via CLI or environment variable.
    - Invalid log levels are rejected with a clear error message and exit code 2.
    - Logging is robust and consistent across the codebase.
- [x] **Default to --help:**
    - If main.py is called with no parameters, the CLI now defaults to showing the help message and exits cleanly.
- [x] **Input Validation for Dates:**
    - The `--start` argument is now validated to ensure it matches the YYYY-MM-DD format.
    - If the format is invalid, an error is logged and the program exits with code 2.
- [x] **Exit Code on Failure:**
    - The script now tracks if any ticker fails during analysis.
    - If any failures occur, the program exits with code 1; otherwise, it exits with code 0. This supports automation and CI/CD integration.

## Outstanding (Detailed)
- [ ] **No Progress Indicator:**
    - For multi-ticker analysis, add a progress bar (e.g., using `tqdm`) to show progress through the ticker list.
    - Make this optional or auto-disable for single-ticker runs.
- [ ] **Docstring Updates:**
    - Update the main module and function docstrings to explicitly mention:
        - The modular structure (input, data fetching, validation, computation, reporting)
        - The robust error handling approach
        - The extensibility and testability principles
