# Refactoring Plan: Modularization & Function Decomposition

## Guidelines
- No new features or removals during refactoring.
- No regressionsâ€”ensure all tests pass and functionality is preserved.
- Refactor for structure, modularity, and readability only.
- All interfaces and outputs must remain unchanged unless strictly necessary (and documented).
- Use incremental, testable changes and validate after each major step.

## Goals
- Break up any Python file over 300 lines into smaller, focused modules.
- Refactor long functions into smaller, testable units.
- Improve readability, maintainability, and testability.
- Preserve all existing functionality and interfaces.
- Update imports and documentation as needed.

## Refactoring Progress Summary

**All major refactoring and modularization tasks are complete.**

- All large files (>300 lines) have been split into logical modules.
- All long functions (>50 lines) have been decomposed into helpers.
- Helper modules created for business logic, plotting, OpenAI, and company data.
- Imports and references updated throughout.
- Comprehensive tests added/updated for all new/refactored modules.
- All tests pass; output and interfaces validated.
- Documentation in progress to reflect new structure.

### Remaining Steps
- Final review for any remaining large files or helpers that could be further modularized.
- Manual review for duplicate/dead code or missed imports.
- Update documentation and usage examples for new module structure.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`, and `PLAN.md` to summarize refactoring and architectural decisions.
- Stage, commit, and tag the refactored release.

## Per-File Status (Abbreviated)

- **data_fetching/financials.py**: Split, helpers moved, tests updated, validated.
- **company_profile.py**: Logic moved to helpers, imports updated, tested.
- **company_status.py**: Logic moved to helpers, imports updated, tested.
- **one_stock_analysis.py**: Decomposed, helpers at module level, tested.
- **plotting.py**: Split into helpers and terminal modules, tested.
- **reporting.py**: Decomposed, helpers at module level, tested.
- **api/openai_client.py**: Helpers moved, imports updated, tested.
- **zscore_models.py**: Split into enums, thresholds, base; imports updated, tested.
- **computation/formulas.py**: Already modular, tests added.

**This plan is now a concise summary of the completed refactoring and remaining finalization steps.**
