# Altman Z-Score MVP Code Review - Action Items

## Overview
This document contains recommended actions based on a code review of the MVP version of the Altman Z-Score repository, focusing on stability and stock price plotting issues.

## Stability Issues

### Error Handling Improvements
- [ ] **Exception Handling in `plot_zscore_trend`**: Replace bare `except Exception:` blocks with more specific exception catching and add logging of the specific exception information for easier debugging.
- [ ] **Network Error Resilience**: Improve handling of network errors in `fetch_prices.py` and `one_stock_analysis.py` by implementing more specific exception handling and connection retry logic.
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Add stronger validation of input parameters in key functions to prevent unexpected errors from invalid inputs.
- [ ] **Error Reporting**: Enhance error reporting to include more diagnostic information in the output files when issues occur.

### Code Structure Improvements
- [ ] **Reduce Duplicate Logic**: Eliminate duplicated code for model selection in `one_stock_analysis.py` by refactoring the repeated logic into a single function.
- [ ] **Modularize `analyze_single_stock_zscore_trend`**: Break down the large function into smaller, more focused functions for better maintainability and testability.
- [ ] **Consistent Logging Strategy**: Standardize the logging approach across the codebase to use the Python logging module instead of mixing print statements and logging.
- [ ] **Environment Variable Validation**: Add validation of required environment variables early in execution to prevent cryptic errors later in the pipeline.

### Data Processing Improvements
- [ ] **Date Format Standardization**: Ensure consistent handling of date formats across the codebase to prevent mismatches when comparing dates.
- [ ] **Data Type Safety**: Implement more robust type checking and conversion, particularly when handling numerical values and dates from external sources.
- [ ] **Fallback Options**: Add more fallback options for data fetching to improve resilience when primary sources are unavailable.

## Stock Price Plotting Issues

### Date Alignment Fixes
- [ ] **Quarter End Date Alignment**: Fix the alignment of Z-Score quarters with stock price dates by ensuring consistent date format handling across modules.
- [ ] **Date Comparison Logic**: Refine the logic in `plotting.py` that maps stock price quarters to x-axis positions to ensure correct alignment with Z-Score data points.
- [ ] **Date Format Conversion**: Implement a centralized date handling utility to ensure consistent formatting and comparison of dates throughout the application.

### Plotting Improvements
- [ ] **Secondary X-Axis for Stock Prices**: Implement a secondary date x-axis for stock prices to improve clarity when dates don't perfectly align with Z-Score quarters.
- [ ] **Stock Price Data Fallbacks**: Add fallback options for stock price data when the primary method fails to retrieve prices for certain dates.
- [ ] **Visualization Enhancements**: Improve the visual distinction between Z-Score and stock price data on the chart for better readability.
- [ ] **Empty Data Handling**: Add more robust handling of cases where stock price data is incomplete or empty to prevent plotting failures.

### Debugging Capabilities
- [ ] **Verbose Mode**: Add a verbose mode that can be enabled via command line to output detailed debugging information about the data processing pipeline.
- [ ] **Diagnostic Output**: Create additional diagnostic output files for troubleshooting stock price fetching and alignment issues.
- [ ] **Plot Data Verification**: Add pre-plotting verification of data to ensure all required elements are present before attempting to generate charts.

## Documentation Improvements
- [ ] **Function Documentation**: Enhance docstrings in key functions, especially in `plotting.py` and `fetch_prices.py`, to better explain parameter requirements and return values.
- [ ] **Error Scenarios**: Document common error scenarios and their resolutions to aid in troubleshooting.
- [ ] **Example Usage**: Add more examples of using the tool with different types of stocks to illustrate handling of various edge cases.
- [ ] **Architecture Overview**: Create a high-level architecture diagram or document that explains the data flow between components.

## Testing Recommendations
- [ ] **Unit Tests for Date Alignment**: Create specific unit tests for the date alignment logic in the plotting module.
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests that verify the end-to-end flow including stock price fetching and plotting.
- [ ] **Mock Data Tests**: Implement tests using mock data to verify plotting functionality without relying on external APIs.
- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**: Add tests for edge cases such as stocks with limited price history, recently IPO'd companies, etc.

## Priority Recommendations
The following items should be addressed first to resolve the immediate issues:

1. Fix date alignment logic in `plotting.py` for mapping stock prices to Z-Score quarters.
2. Implement a secondary date x-axis for stock prices when dates don't perfectly align.
3. Improve error handling in the stock price fetching functions to provide better diagnostics.
4. Add more robust pre-plotting verification to prevent chart generation failures.
5. Standardize date handling across all modules to prevent format mismatches.

These changes should establish a more stable codebase and resolve the stock price plotting issues while minimizing changes to the overall architecture.
