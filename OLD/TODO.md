# Altman Z-Score Project Improvements

This document serves as the active project roadmap and task tracking system. It is the primary source for:
- Current project priorities
- Active sprint tasks
- Implementation status
- Completion tracking

For large-scale changes that affect multiple modules or carry significant risks:
1. Check DECISIONS.md for architectural guidelines
2. Create a detailed PLAN.md before implementation
3. Follow implementation steps in PLAN.md
4. Update task status here as work progresses

## Critical/Urgent Tasks
1. **API Response Validation & Data Integrity** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - [x] Implement pydantic models for API responses
   - [ ] Add data quality checks with validation rules
   - [x] Add response format normalization with pydantic transforms
   - [x] Implement structured validation error reporting
   - [x] Add validation metrics tracking
   - [x] Create SEC EDGAR XBRL field validation (Initial pass, ongoing for foreign filings and general data extraction)
     - [ ] **Diagnose and Fix Critical Financial Data Extraction (TA, CL, CA, RE, EBIT, Sales):**
       - [x] Refine XBRL instance document identification (e.g., excluding FilingSummary.xml).
       - [ ] Verify logging captures DEBUG messages from `fetch_financials.py` into `output/application.log`.
       - [ ] Examine logs to understand why critical data points are not extracted by `parse_financials` and `find_xbrl_tag`.
       - [ ] Modify XBRL parsing logic in `fetch_financials.py` to correctly identify and extract all required financial data.
       - [ ] Verify S/TA ratio and other financial ratios are calculated correctly after data extraction fix.
   - [x] Debug and fix XBRL parsing for foreign tickers (e.g., BABA, PDD) using 20-F filings. (Partially complete - `debug_xbrl.py` can fetch data, `fetch_financials.py` error resolved. Next: verify `find_xbrl_tag` extracts correct annual data for BABA 20-F, and integrate with main data extraction fix above).
   - [x] Add Yahoo Finance data validation
   - [x] Implement cross-source data consistency checks
   - [x] Resolve `KeyError: 'CA'` in `src/altman_zscore/compute_zscore.py` (Addressed by ensuring correct data mapping/availability).
   - [ ] Address data validation warnings/errors for companies like AMZN, BBBY.

2. **Direct Data Access Enhancement** (URGENT)
   - [ ] Implement robust error handling for API requests
     - [ ] Handle HTTP errors (4xx, 5xx)
     - [ ] Handle JSON parsing errors
     - [ ] Handle timeouts
   - [x] Add comprehensive request logging (Initial setup done, ongoing verification and refinement for DEBUG level from all modules)
     - [ ] Ensure `main.py` logging configuration correctly captures DEBUG logs from all modules (esp. `fetch_financials.py`) into `output/application.log`.
   - [x] Implement request rate limiting (Initial implementation in place)
     - [ ] Confirm rate limiter integration in all clients
     - [ ] Configure rate limiter thresholds via config
   - [x] Add request analytics and metrics
     - [ ] Integrate Prometheus metrics
     - [ ] Expose metrics endpoint
   - [ ] Create API usage monitoring
     - [ ] Log request counts per endpoint
     - [ ] Alert on high error rates
   - [ ] Implement comprehensive testing suite
     - [ ] Unit tests for SEC EDGAR API client
     - [ ] Unit tests for Yahoo Finance API client
     - [ ] Integration tests for API interactions
     - [ ] Integration tests for API interactions (sec & yahoo using real data)
     - [ ] Error case testing
     - [ ] Rate limit testing

3. **Error Recovery System** (URGENT)
   - [ ] Create error categorization framework
     - [ ] Define error taxonomy for SEC EDGAR client
     - [ ] Define error taxonomy for Yahoo Finance client
   - [ ] Implement context-sensitive retry logic
     - [ ] Retry network errors with exponential backoff
     - [ ] Retry parsing errors with fallback handling
   - [ ] Add fallback data sources
     - [ ] Integrate alternative SEC API endpoint
     - [ ] Add fallback to alternative market data API (e.g., Alpha Vantage)
   - [ ] Enhance error reporting system
     - [ ] Centralize error logging dashboard integration
     - [ ] Add alerting for critical errors
   - [ ] Create error recovery metrics dashboard
     - [ ] Track retry success rate
     - [ ] Monitor fallback usage frequency
     - [ ] Log error category distribution

- [x] Rename `src/altman_zscore/main.py` to `portfolio_analyzer.py` and update `analyze.py` imports
- [x] Remove `build/` and `altman_zscore.egg-info` directories and add to `.gitignore`
- [x] Remove `.devcontainer/`, `venv/`, and `.venv/` directories and update `.gitignore`
- [ ] Harmonize `Config` class attributes vs code usage:
  - Align property names (`sec_user_agent`, `period_end_date`, etc.) with code expectations (`SEC_USER_AGENT`, `PERIOD_END`, etc.)
  - Define missing constants in `Config` (`LOG_FILE_NAME`, `DEFAULT_PRICE_HISTORY_DAYS`)
  - Update `portfolio_analyzer.py` imports and attribute references accordingly

## Critical/Urgent Tasks (continued)
- [x] **URGENT: Full Refactor of `portfolio_analyzer.py`**
  - [x] Remove placeholder classes (`CIKLookup`, `FetchFinancials`, `FetchPrices`, `ComputeZScore`, `DataValidator`) and undefined imports.
  - [x] Replace with real functions/classes: `lookup_cik`, `classify_company`, `fetch_financials`, `get_market_data`/`get_closest_price`, `compute_zscore`, `FinancialDataValidator.validate`.
  - [x] Implement `FinancialData` adapter or use existing data models to map `fetch_financials` output to input for `compute_zscore`.
  - [x] Simplify model selection logic: map `IndustryGroup.MANUFACTURING` to `ORIGINAL`, emerging markets to `EM`, others to `SERVICE` (or as per specs).
  - [x] Clean up logging to only reference fields present on `CompanyProfile` and `FinancialData`.
  - [x] Build output rows using `ZScoreComponents` properties or plain dicts; remove `ZScoreResult` references.
  - [x] Write or update unit tests covering the refactored `portfolio_analyzer.py`.
  - [ ] Confirm end-to-end execution in Codespaces, fixing any compile or runtime errors.

- [x] Clean up any remaining compile errors and undefined symbols in `src/altman_zscore/portfolio_analyzer.py`.
- [ ] Mark these subtasks off when complete.
