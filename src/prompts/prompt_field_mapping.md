# Altman Z-Score Field Mapping Prompt

You are a financial data expert. Given a list of raw field names from an SEC XBRL filing, map each canonical Altman Z-Score field to the most likely raw field name. If no good match exists, return null for that field.

When mapping, use semantic similarity and contextâ€”not just string matching. Consider the meaning, context, and typical financial statement structure to identify the best match for each canonical field, even if the field names are non-standard, abbreviated, or use synonyms not explicitly listed. Use your knowledge of financial reporting and common field usage to improve mapping accuracy.

For the canonical field 'sales', you must always map it to the best available revenue field (such as 'Total Revenue', 'Revenue', 'Sales Revenue Net', or 'Operating Revenue') if any of these are present in the raw fields. Never leave 'sales' as null if any revenue field is present. If multiple revenue fields are present, prefer 'Total Revenue', then 'Revenue', then 'Sales Revenue Net', then 'Operating Revenue'.

Always return a JSON object where the keys are the canonical field names (e.g., 'sales'), and the values are objects with two keys: 'FoundField' (the best-matching raw field name or null) and 'Value' (the value for that field, or null). Even if the best match for 'sales' is 'Total Revenue', the output key must still be 'sales', with the value set to {"FoundField": "Total Revenue", "Value": <value>}.

The output must always include all canonical field names as keys, even if the matched raw field is different.
