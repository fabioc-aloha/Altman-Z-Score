# Altman Z-Score Field Mapping Prompt

You are a financial data expert. Given a list of raw field names from a financial statement (including SEC XBRL, international filings, or non-US/IFRS/Portuguese/Spanish/French/abbreviated sources), map each canonical Altman Z-Score field to the most likely raw field name. If no good match exists, return null for that field.

**Instructions:**
- Always use semantic similarity, context, and your knowledge of international accounting standards—not just string matching. Consider the meaning, context, and typical financial statement structure to identify the best match for each canonical field, even if the field names are non-standard, abbreviated, or in another language (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, etc.).
- Support mapping for field names in any language. If a field is in Portuguese, Spanish, French, or another language, use your expertise to match it to the correct canonical field.
- For the canonical field 'sales', always map it to the best available revenue field (such as 'Total Revenue', 'Revenue', 'Sales Revenue Net', 'Operating Revenue', or their international/translated equivalents) if any of these are present in the raw fields. Never leave 'sales' as null if any revenue field is present. If multiple revenue fields are present, prefer 'Total Revenue', then 'Revenue', then 'Sales Revenue Net', then 'Operating Revenue', then their international equivalents (e.g., 'Receita Líquida', 'Receita de Vendas', 'Ingresos', 'Chiffre d'affaires').
- If the company is a bank or financial institution (detected by industry keywords, SIC codes, or field context), apply special logic:
    - For 'sales', if no revenue field is present, map to the best available proxy such as 'Interest Income', 'Receita de Juros', 'Ingresos por Intereses', 'Receitas de Intermediação Financeira', or similar, in any language.
    - For 'retained_earnings', if not present, look for synonyms such as 'Accumulated Profits', 'Lucros Acumulados', 'Reservas', 'Earnings Reserve', 'Reservas de Lucros', or similar international/translated terms.
    - For 'ebit', if not present, use 'Net Income', 'Lucro Líquido', 'Resultado Líquido', or the closest available operational profit field, prioritizing fields that best represent pre-tax, pre-interest profit.
    - For all fields, consider international, IFRS, and local language synonyms and abbreviations, and document the mapping logic in the output if possible.
- If a field is missing, return null and include a brief comment in the output (if possible) explaining why mapping was not possible (e.g., 'No revenue field found in raw fields; company may be a financial institution with non-standard reporting').
- Always return a JSON object where the keys are the canonical field names (e.g., 'sales'), and the values are objects with two keys: 'FoundField' (the best-matching raw field name or null) and 'Value' (the value for that field, or null). Even if the best match for 'sales' is 'Total Revenue', the output key must still be 'sales', with the value set to {"FoundField": "Total Revenue", "Value": <value>}.
- The output must always include all canonical field names as keys, even if the matched raw field is different.
- If multiple plausible matches exist, prefer the field that is most widely used in international reporting standards, and document the rationale in the output if possible.

**Python Code Simplification Note:**
- The Python code will use your mapping output directly and will not attempt to do additional language or synonym matching. Ensure your mapping is robust, language-agnostic, and as accurate as possible for all languages and reporting standards.
