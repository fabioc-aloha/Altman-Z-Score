- **âœ… Critical import fixes:** Resolved all ModuleNotFoundError issues across the codebase

### Changed
- **âœ… All imports updated:** Use new modular paths (e.g., `from altman_zscore.plotting.plotting_main import plot_zscore_trend`)
- **âœ… Improved LLM prompt templates:** Enhanced code injection for reporting with more complete, context-aware, and robust analysis outputs
- **âœ… Documentation updated:** All documentation reflects new structure and completed modularization

### Fixed
- **âœ… Import errors:** Fixed critical import paths in `fetcher_factory.py`, `industry_classifier.py`, and other core modules
- **âœ… Main pipeline:** Successfully runs `python main.py msft` without import errors
- **âœ… Test collection:** Fixed pytest issues in `test_finnhub.py` by removing `sys.exit(1)` and renaming helper functions

### Technical
- **âœ… All tests passing:** Both unit tests and integration tests pass after reorganization
- **âœ… Cleaned up obsolete files:** Removed duplicate files marked with 'D' in VS Code after reorganization
- **âœ… Main pipeline verified:** Integration testing confirms the modular structure works correctly
